= Upgrading Open Data Hub

[role='_abstract']
You can upgrade the Open Data Hub Operator from version 1 to version 2 using the OpenShift web console. 
For information about installing the Open Hub Operator version 2, see link:{odhdocshome}/installing-open-data-hub/#installing-odh-v2_installv2[Installing Open Data Hub version 2].

Upgrading Open Data Hub involves the following tasks:

. Upgrading the Open Data Hub Operator.
. Installing Open Data Hub components.
. Accessing the Open Data Hub dashboard.

[NOTE]
--
* If the current application namespace for Open Data Hub version 1 is not `opendatahub`, you must scale down the components before upgrading.
* Version 2 of the Open Data Hub Operator represents an alpha release, accessible only on the `fast` channel. Later releases will change to the `rolling` channel when the Operator is more stable.
