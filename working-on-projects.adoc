= Working on projects

[role='_abstract']
As a data scientist, you can organize your data science work into a single project. A project in {productname-short} can consist of the following components:

Workbenches:: Creating a workbench allows you to work with models in your preferred IDE, such as JupyterLab.
Cluster storage:: For projects that require data retention, you can add cluster storage to the project.
Connections:: Adding a connection to your project allows you to connect data sources and sinks to your workbenches.
Pipelines:: Standardize and automate machine learning workflows to enable you to further enhance and deploy your data science models.
Models and model servers:: Deploy a trained data science model to serve intelligent applications. Your model is deployed with an endpoint that allows applications to send requests to the model.
ifdef::upstream[]
Bias metrics for models:: Creating bias metrics allows you to monitor your machine learning models for bias.
