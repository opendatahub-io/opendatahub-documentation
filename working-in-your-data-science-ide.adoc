In {productname-long}, when you create a workbench, you select a workbench image that includes an IDE (integrated development environment) for developing your machine learning models. 

{productname-short} supports the following data science IDEs for developing ML models:

* JupyterLab
* code-server
//* RStudio Server

== Working in code-server

Code-server is a web-based interactive development environment supporting multiple programming languages, including Python, for working with Jupyter notebooks. With the code-server workbench image, you can customize your workbench environment to meet your needs using a variety of extensions to add new languages, themes, debuggers, and connect to additional services.
