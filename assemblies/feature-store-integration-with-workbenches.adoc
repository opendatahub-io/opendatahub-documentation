= Feature Store integration with workbenches
 
[role='_abstract']
The integration of Feature Store with Red Hat {org-name} workbenches resolves the competing demands of agility and security. This capability removes the friction of manual configuration and script copying, accelerating workflows and enabling seamless feature management directly within Jupyter notebooks. This efficiency is achieved with a governance framework that ensures scalable, role-based access control (RBAC) and secure authentication. This safeguards sensitive data and mitigates vulnerabilities enterprise-wide.
