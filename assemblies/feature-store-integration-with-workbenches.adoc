= Feature Store integration with workbenches
 
[role='_abstract']
The integration of Feature Store with {org-name} workbenches resolves the competing demands of agility and security. This capability removes the friction of manual configuration and script copying, accelerating workflows and enabling seamless feature management directly within Jupyter notebooks. A governance framework ensures efficiency, scalable, role-based access control (RBAC), and secure authentication. This safeguards sensitive data and mitigates vulnerabilities enterprise-wide.
