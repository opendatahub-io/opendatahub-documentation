In {productname-long}, a connection comprises environment variables along with their respective values. Data scientists can add connections to workbenches, model servers, and pipelines.

{productname-short} includes pre-installed connection types for S3 compatible object storage databases and URI-based repositories. Connection types include customizable fields and optional default values to decrease the time required to add connections to data sources and sinks. 

As an {productname-short} administrator, you can manage custom connection types for users in your organization as follows:

* View connection types and preview user connection forms
* Create a connection type
* Duplicate an existing connection type
* Edit an existing connection type
* Delete a custom connection type
* Enable or disable a connection type to control whether it is available as an option to your users when they create an {productname-short} connection.
