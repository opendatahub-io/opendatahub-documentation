Certificates are used by various components in {openshift-platform} to validate access to the cluster. For clusters that rely on self-signed certificates, you can add those self-signed certificates to a cluster-wide Certificate Authority (CA) bundle and use the CA bundle in {productname-long}. You can also use self-signed certificates in a custom CA bundle that is separate from the cluster-wide bundle. Administrators can add a CA bundle, remove a CA bundle from all namespaces, remove a CA bundle from individual namespaces, or manually manage certificate changes instead of the system.

== Using self-signed certificates with {productname-short} components

Some {productname-short} components have additional options or required configuration for self-signed certificates.
