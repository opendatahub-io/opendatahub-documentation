== Monitor tier usage

You can monitor tier usage and resource consumption through the MaaS observability stack.

.Procedure

. Access the Grafana dashboard:
.. In the {openshift-platform} console, navigate to *Networking* -> *Routes*.
.. From the *Project* list, select the namespace where Grafana is deployed.
.. Click the Grafana route URL to open the Grafana dashboard.
. Navigate to the MaaS metrics dashboard.
. View tier-specific metrics:
.. *Requests per tier*: Total API requests broken down by tier.
.. *Allowed requests*: Requests that passed rate limiting.
.. *Denied requests*: Requests that were rate-limited.
.. *Token consumption*: Number of tokens consumed per tier.
. Use these metrics to:
.. Identify tiers approaching rate limits.
.. Plan capacity adjustments.
.. Detect unusual usage patterns.
.. Make informed decisions about tier configuration changes.
