= Working on data science projects

[role='_abstract']
As a data scientist, you can organize your data science work into a single project. A data science project in {productname-short} can consist of the following components:

Workbenches:: Creating a workbench allows you to add a Jupyter notebook to your project.
Cluster storage:: For data science projects that require data retention, you can add cluster storage to the project.
Data connections:: Adding a data connection to your project allows you to connect data inputs to your workbenches.
Models and model servers:: Deploy a trained data science model to serve intelligent applications. Your model is deployed with an endpoint that allows applications to send requests to the model.
ifdef::upstream[]
Bias metrics for models:: Creating bias metrics allows you to monitor your machine learning models for bias. 
endif::[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you create an OpenShift project outside of the {productname-short} user interface, the project is not shown on the *Data science projects* page. In addition, you cannot use features exclusive to {productname-short}, such as workbenches and model serving, with a standard OpenShift project.

To classify your OpenShift project as a data science project, and to make available features exclusive to {productname-short}, you must add the label `opendatahub.io/dashboard: 'true'` to the project namespace. After you add this label, your project is subsequently shown on the *Data science projects* page.

//[IMPORTANT]
//====
//OpenShift AI sends notifications to nominated email addresses (usually your administrator) when the storage for your notebook server is 90% full, and again when it is completely full.

//If you download a very large data set, your storage can fill up before your administrator receives a notification, so you might run out of room before your administrator can give you more storage.

//To avoid this issue, stream larger data sets from external services where possible, as opposed to downloading them. Alternatively, if you need to download larger data sets, you can proactively request more storage from your administrator, to ensure you have sufficient space. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/4.9/html-single/scaling_storage/index#doc-wrapper[Scaling storage].
