= Working on data science projects

[role='_abstract']
As a data scientist, you can organize your data science work into a single project. A data science project in {productname-short} can consist of the following components:

Workbenches:: Creating a workbench allows you to add a Jupyter notebook to your project.
Cluster storage:: For data science projects that require data retention, you can add cluster storage to the project.
Data connections:: Adding a data connection to your project allows you to connect data inputs to your workbenches.
Pipelines:: Standardize and automate machine learning workflows to enable you to further enhance and deploy your data science models.
Models and model servers:: Deploy a trained data science model to serve intelligent applications. Your model is deployed with an endpoint that allows applications to send requests to the model.
ifdef::upstream[]
Bias metrics for models:: Creating bias metrics allows you to monitor your machine learning models for bias.
endif::[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you create an OpenShift project outside of the {productname-short} user interface, the project is not shown on the *Data Science Projects* page. In addition, you cannot use features exclusive to {productname-short}, such as workbenches and model serving, with a standard OpenShift project.

To classify your OpenShift project as a data science project, and to make available features exclusive to {productname-short}, you must add the label `opendatahub.io/dashboard: 'true'` to the project namespace. After you add this label, your project is subsequently shown on the *Data Science Projects* page.
