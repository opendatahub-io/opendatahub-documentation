= Upgrading Open Data Hub version 2.0 to version 2.2

[role='_abstract']
You can upgrade the Open Data Hub Operator from version 2.0 or 2.1 to version 2.2 or later by using the OpenShift console. 
For information about upgrading from version 1 to version 2.2 or later, see link:{odhdocshome}/upgrading-open-data-hub/#upgrading-the-odh-operator-v1_upgradev1[Upgrading Open Data Hub version 1 to version 2].
For information about installing the Open Hub Operator, see link:{odhdocshome}/installing-open-data-hub/#installing-the-odh-operator-v2_installv2[Installing Open Data Hub Operator version 2].

[NOTE]
--
After you upgrade to {productname-short} 2.10.0, pipelines created with DSP 1.0 will continue to run, but will be inaccessible from the {productname-short} dashboard. We recommend that current DSP users do not install {productname-short} 2.10.0 until you are ready to migrate to the new pipelines solution.
--
[IMPORTANT]
====
Data Science Pipelines (DSP) 2.0 contains an installation of Argo Workflows. {productname-short} does not support direct customer usage of this installation of Argo Workflows.

If you upgrade to {productname-short} 2.10.0 with DSP enabled and an Argo Workflows installation that is not installed by DSP exists on your cluster, {productname-short} components will not be upgraded. To complete the component upgrade, disable DSP or remove the separate installation of Argo Workflows. The component upgrade will complete automatically.
====

Note that Open Data Hub Operator versions 2.2 and later use an upgraded API version for a DataScienceCluster instance, resulting in the following differences.

.DataScienceCluster instance differences
|===
| | ODH 2.1 and earlier | ODH 2.2 and later

|API version
|`v1alpha1`
|`v1`

|Enable component
|`.spec.components.[component_name].enabled: true`
|`.spec.components.[component_name].managementState: Managed`

|Disable component
|`.spec.components.[component_name].enabled: false`
|`.spec.components.[component_name].managementState: Removed`

Upgrading Open Data Hub involves the following tasks:

. Cleaning up resources from the previous version of {productname-short}.
. Installing version 2.2 or later of {productname-short}.
. If using self-signed certificates, adding a CA bundle.
