= Monitoring distributed training workloads

[role='_abstract']

In {productname-short}, you can view project metrics for distributed workloads, and view the status of all distributed workloads in the selected project.
You can use these metrics to monitor the resources used by distributed workloads, assess whether project resources are allocated correctly, track the progress of distributed workloads, and identify corrective action when necessary.

[NOTE]
====
Data science pipelines workloads are not managed by the distributed workloads feature, and are not included in the distributed workloads metrics.
