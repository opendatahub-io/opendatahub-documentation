= Managing distributed workloads

[role='_abstract']
In {productname-short}, distributed workloads like `PyTorchJob`, `RayJob`, and `RayCluster` are created and managed by their respective workload operators. Kueue integrates with these operators to function as a scheduler, managing job queuing and deciding when workloads can run based on cluster-wide quotas.

You can perform advanced configuration for your distributed workloads environment, such as changing the default behavior of the CodeFlare Operator or setting up a cluster for RDMA.
