= Set up your working environment

To set up your working environment for customizing models, complete these tasks:

. For disconnected environments, mirror the {org-name} index.

. Create a custom workbench image that is based on a base image that is configured to use the {org-name} Python index and install packages. Install JupyterLab in your custom workbench image so that you can run example notebooks.


. From your running workbench, import example notebooks.
