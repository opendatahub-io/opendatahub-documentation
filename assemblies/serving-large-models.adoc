= Serving large models

[role='_abstract']
For deploying large models such as large language models (LLMs), {productname-long} includes a single-model serving platform that is based on the KServe component. Because each model is deployed from its own model server, the single-model serving platform helps you to deploy, monitor, scale, and maintain large models that require more resources.

== Monitoring model performance

In the single-model serving platform, you can view performance metrics for a specific model that is deployed on the platform.

include::modules/viewing-performance-metrics-for-deployed-model.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

== Optimizing model-serving runtimes

You can optionally enhance the preinstalled model-serving runtimes available in {productname-short} to leverage additional benefits and capabilities, such as optimized inferencing, reduced latency, and fine-tuned resource allocation.

== Performance tuning on the single-model serving platform
Certain performance issues might require you to tune the parameters of your inference service or model-serving runtime.
