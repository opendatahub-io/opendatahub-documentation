= Setting up model monitoring

[role='_abstract']

To set up model monitoring for data scientists to use in {productname-short}, a cluster administrator does the following tasks:

* Configure monitoring for the model serving platform
* Enable the TrustyAI component in the {productname-long} {install-package}
* Install the TrustyAI service on each data science project that contains models that the data scientists want to monitor

[NOTE]
====
Model monitoring with TrustyAI is only available on the ModelMesh-based _multi-model serving platform_. Model monitoring with TrustyAI is unavailable on the KServe-based _single-model serving platform_.
