= Configuring TrustyAI

[role='_abstract']

To configure model monitoring with TrustyAI for data scientists to use in {productname-short}, a cluster administrator does the following tasks:

* Configure monitoring for the model serving platform
* Enable the TrustyAI component in the {productname-long} {install-package}
* Configure TrustyAI to use a database, if you want to use your database instead of a PVC for storage with TrustyAI
* Install the TrustyAI service on each data science project that contains models that the data scientists want to monitor
//add users to the {openshift-platform} cluster 

[NOTE]
====
Model monitoring with TrustyAI is only available on the ModelMesh-based _multi-model serving platform_. Model monitoring with TrustyAI is unavailable on the KServe-based _single-model serving platform_.
