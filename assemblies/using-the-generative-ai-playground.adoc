= Using the Generative AI Playground

[role='_abstract']
The Generative AI (GenAI) Playground in {productname-short} provides an integrated environment for experimenting with large language models (LLMs). From the Gen AI Playground, you can select and configure models, test prompts, and upload documents to enable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Together, these capabilities support model evaluation and prompt refinement before integrating models into applications or workflows.
