= Enforcing the use of local queues

[role='_abstract']

Efficient workload orchestration in {openshift-platform} clusters relies on strict management of resources and queues. 
Cluster administrators can use the Validating Admission Policy feature to enforce the mandatory labeling of RayCluster resources with Local Queue identifiers.
This labeling ensures that workloads are properly categorized and routed based on queue management policies, which prevents resource contention and enhances operational efficiency.

[NOTE]
====
The Validating Admission Policy feature is available in {openshift-platform} v4.17 or later.
