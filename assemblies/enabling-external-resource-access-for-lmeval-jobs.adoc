= Enabling external resource access for LMEval jobs

[role='_abstract']
LMEval jobs do not allow internet access or remote code execution by default. When configuring an `LMEvalJob`, it may require access to external resources, for example task datasets and model tokenizers, usually hosted on link:https://huggingface.co[Hugging Face]. If you trust the source and have reviewed the content of these artifacts, an `LMEvalJob` can be configured to automatically download them.

Follow the steps below to enable online access and remote code execution for LMEval jobs. Choose to update these settings by using either the CLI or in the console. Enable one or both settings according to your needs.
