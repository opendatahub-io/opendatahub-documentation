= Overview of machine learning features and Feature Store

[role='_abstract']

A machine learning (ML) feature is a measurable property or attribute within a data set that a machine learning model can analyze to learn patterns and make decisions. Examples of features include a customer's purchase history, demographic data like age and location, weather conditions, and financial market data. You can use these features to train models for tasks such as personalized product recommendations, fraud detection, and predictive maintenance.

Feature Store is a {productname-long} component that provides a centralized repository that stores, manages, and serves machine learning features for both training and inference purposes.
