= Monitoring data science models for bias

The TrustyAI service provides data scientists with value-added capabilities, such as explainability (enriching model execution information through XAI algorithms) and model bias detection.

[NOTE]
====
The monitoring models for bias (TrustyAI feature) is supported only on a _multi-model serving platform_ that is based on the ModelMesh component. It is not supported on a _single model serving platform_ that is based on the KServe component.
