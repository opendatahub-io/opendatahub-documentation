= Monitoring the training job

[role='_abstract']
When you run a training job to tune a model, you can monitor the progress of the job.
The example training job in this section is based on the IBM and Hugging Face tuning example provided link:https://github.com/foundation-model-stack/fms-hf-tuning/tree/main/examples/prompt_tuning_twitter_complaints[here]. 


.Prerequisites

ifndef::upstream[]
* You have access to a data science cluster that is configured to run distributed workloads as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/managing_openshift_ai/managing_distributed_workloads[Managing distributed workloads].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* You have access to a data science cluster that is configured to run distributed workloads as described in link:{odhdocshome}/managing-openshift-ai/#managing_distributed_workloads[Managing distributed workloads].
endif::[]

ifndef::upstream[]
* You have created a data science project. 
For information about how to create a project, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/using-data-science-projects_projects#creating-a-data-science-project_projects[Creating a data science project].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* You have created a data science project. 
For information about how to create a project, see link:{odhdocshome}/working-on-data-science-projects/#creating-a-data-science-project_projects[Creating a data science project].
endif::[]

* You have Admin access for the data science project.
** If you created the project, you automatically have Admin access. 
** If you did not create the project, your cluster administrator must give you Admin access.

* You have access to a model.
* You have access to data that you can use to train the model.

ifndef::upstream[]
* You are running the training job as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_distributed_workloads/tuning-a-model-by-using-the-training-operator_distributed-workloads#running-the-training-job_distributed-workloads[Running the training job].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* You are running the training job as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-distributed-workloads/#running-the-training-job_distributed-workloads[Running the training job].
endif::[]

.Procedure
ifdef::upstream,self-managed[]
. In the {openshift-platform} console, select your project from the *Project* list. 
endif::[]
ifdef::cloud-service[]
. In the OpenShift console, select your project from the *Project* list.
endif::[]
. Click *Workloads* -> *Pods*.

. Search for the pod that corresponds to the PyTorch job, that is, *_<training-job-name>_-master-0*.
+
For example, if the training job name is `kfto-demo`, the pod name is *kfto-demo-master-0*.

. Click the pod name to open the pod details page.

. Click the *Logs* tab to monitor the progress of the job and view status updates, as shown in the following example output:
