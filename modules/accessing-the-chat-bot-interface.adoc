= Accessing the chat bot interface

[role='_abstract']
Embedding a Llama stack large language model (LLM) chat bot interface directly into a data science project gives you immediate, context-aware assistance without switching tools. You can use this interface to quickly explore model parameters, troubleshoot errors, and experiment interactively within a data science project. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
By default, the chat bot interface is hidden from display within the data science project user interface. To show the user interface components for the chat bot interface, set the `disableLlamaStackClient` value to `false` in the `OdhDashboardConfig` custom resource (CR) in {openshift-platform}.

* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* You have created a data science project.
* You have deployed the Llama Stack Operator.
* You have configured a LlamaStackDistribution custom resource (CR) with a vLLM inference service and a Milvus vector database.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Data science projects*.
+
The *Data science projects* page opens.
. Click the data science project for which you want to access the chat bot.
+
A project details page opens.
. Click the *Chat bot* tab.
+
The LlamaStack chat bot interface displays. 

.Verification
* You can access the *Chat bot* tab from within a data science project.
* You can successfully send queries to the chat bot and then receive relevant answers.
