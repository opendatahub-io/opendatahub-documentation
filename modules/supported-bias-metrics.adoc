{productname-long} supports the following bias metrics.

//== Demographic parity metrics

Statistical Parity Difference::

_Statistical Parity Difference_ (SPD) is the difference in the probability of a favorable outcome prediction between unprivileged and privileged groups. The formal definition of SPD is the following:

* _&#375;_ = 1 is the favorable outcome.
* _D&#7524;_ and _D&#8346;_ are the unprivileged and privileged group data.

You can interpret SPD values as follows:

* A value of `0` means that the model is behaving fairly for a selected attribute (for example,  race, gender).
* A value in the range  `-0.1` to `0.1` means that the model is reasonably fair for a selected attribute. Instead, you can attribute the difference in probability to other factors, such as the sample size.
* A value outside the range `-0.1` to `0.1` indicates that the model is unfair for a selected attribute.
* A negative value indicates that the model has bias against the unprivileged group.
* A positive value indicates that the model has bias against the privileged group.

Disparate Impact Ratio::

_Disparate Impact Ratio_ (DIR) is the ratio of the probability of a favorable outcome prediction for unprivileged groups to that of privileged groups. The formal definition of DIR is the following:

* _&#375;_ = 1 is the favorable outcome.
* _D&#7524;_ and _D&#8346;_ are the unprivileged and privileged group data.

The threshold to identify bias depends on your own criteria and specific use case.

For example, if your threshold for identifying bias is represented  by a DIR value below `0.8` or above `1.2`, you can interpret the DIR values as follows:

* A value of `1` means that the model is fair for a selected attribute.
* A value of between `0.8` and `1.2` means that the model is reasonably fair for a selected attribute.
* A value below `0.8` or above `1.2` indicates bias.

//Average Odds Difference::

//--
//_Average Odds Difference_ measures the difference between the _True Positive Rates_ (TPR) for the privileged and unprivileged groups, and the _False Positive Rates_ (FPR) for the same groups. The formal defintion of AOD is the following:
//
//image::images/bias-metric-aod.png[SPD definition, scale=65, align="center"]
//
//* _FPR&#7524;_ and _FPR&#8346;_  are the FPR data for the unprivileged and privileged groups.
//* _TPR&#7524;_ and _TPR&#8346;_  are the TPR data for the unprivileged and privileged groups.
//
//You can interpret AOD values as follows:
//
//* A fair model has an AOD value of `0`.
//* A positive value indicates the model benefits the unprivileged group.
//* A negative value indicates the model benefits the privileged group
