== Enabling graph generation for an existing NIM deployment
The following procedure describes how to enable graph generation for an existing NIM deployment.

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator privileges for your {openshift-platform} cluster.
ifdef::upstream,self-managed[]
* You have downloaded and installed the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI). For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI^].
endif::[]
ifdef::cloud-service[]
* You have downloaded and installed the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI). For more information, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/dedicated/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI^] (Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated) or link:https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI^] (Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS).
endif::[]
* You have an existing NIM deployment in {productname-short}.

.Procedure
. In a terminal window, if you are not already logged in to your {openshift-platform} cluster as a cluster administrator, log in to the OpenShift CLI.
. Confirm the name of the `ServingRuntime` associated with your NIM deployment:
+
[source]
----
oc get servingruntime -n <namespace>
----  
+
Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace of the project where your NIM model is deployed. 
. Check for an existing `metadata.annotations` section in the `ServingRuntime` configuration:
+
[source]
----
oc get servingruntime -n  <namespace> <servingruntime-name> -o json | jq '.metadata.annotations'
---- 
+
Replace <servingruntime-name> with the name of the `ServingRuntime` from the previous step.
. Perform one of the following actions:
.. If the `metadata.annotations` section is not present in the configuration, add the section with the required annotations:
+
[source]
----
oc patch servingruntime -n <namespace> <servingruntime-name> --type json --patch \
 '[{"op": "add", "path": "/metadata/annotations", "value": {"runtimes.opendatahub.io/nvidia-nim": "true"}}]'
----
+
You see output similar to the following:
+
[source]
----
servingruntime.serving.kserve.io/nim-serving-runtime patched
----
.. If there is an existing `metadata.annotations` section, add the required annotations to the section:
+
[source]
----
oc patch servingruntime -n <project-namespace> <runtime-name> --type json --patch \
 '[{"op": "add", "path": "/metadata/annotations/runtimes.opendatahub.io~1nvidia-nim", "value": "true"}]'
----
+
You see output similar to the following:
+
[source]
----
servingruntime.serving.kserve.io/nim-serving-runtime patched
----

 
.Verification

* Confirm that the annotation has been added to the `ServingRuntime` of your existing NIM deployment.
+
[source]
----
oc get servingruntime -n <namespace> <servingruntime-name> -o json | jq '.metadata.annotations'
----
+
The annotation that you added is displayed in the output:
+
[source]
----
...
"runtimes.opendatahub.io/nvidia-nim": "true"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
For metrics to be available for graph generation, you must also enable metrics collection for your deployment. Please see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/serving_models/serving-large-models_serving-large-models#enabling_metrics_collection_for_an_existing_nim_deployment[Enabling metrics collection for an existing NIM deployment].

== Enabling metrics collection for an existing NIM deployment

To enable metrics collection for your existing NIM deployment, you must manually add the Prometheus endpoint and port annotations to the `InferenceService` of your deployment. 

The following procedure describes how to add the required Prometheus annotations to the `InferenceService` of your NIM deployment. 

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator privileges for your {openshift-platform} cluster.
ifdef::upstream,self-managed[]
* You have downloaded and installed the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI). For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI^].

* You have an existing NIM deployment in {productname-short}.

.Procedure

. Confirm the name of the `InferenceService` associated with your NIM deployment:
+
[source]
----
oc get inferenceservice -n <namespace>
----
+
Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace of the project where your NIM model is deployed.
. Check if there is an existing `spec.predictor.annotations` section in the `InferenceService` configuration:
+
[source]
----
oc get inferenceservice -n <namespace> <inferenceservice-name> -o json | jq '.spec.predictor.annotations'
----
+
Replace <inferenceservice-name> with the name of the `InferenceService` from the previous step.
. Perform one of the following actions:
.. If the `spec.predictor.annotations` section does not exist in the configuration, add the section and required annotations:
+
[source]
----
oc patch inferenceservice -n <namespace> <inference-name> --type json --patch \
 '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/predictor/annotations", "value": {"prometheus.io/path": "/metrics", "prometheus.io/port": "8000"}}]'
----
+
The annotation that you added is displayed in the output:
+
[source]
----
inferenceservice.serving.kserve.io/nim-serving-runtime patched
----
.. If there is an existing `spec.predictor.annotations` section, add the Prometheus annotations to the section:
+
[source]
----
oc patch inferenceservice -n <namespace> <inference-service-name> --type json --patch \
 '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/predictor/annotations/prometheus.io~1path", "value": "/metrics"},
 {"op": "add", "path": "/spec/predictor/annotations/prometheus.io~1port", "value": "8000"}]'
---- 
+
The annotations that you added is displayed in the output:
+
[source]
----
inferenceservice.serving.kserve.io/nim-serving-runtime patched
----

.Verification

* Confirm that the annotations have been added to the `InferenceService`.
+
[source]
----
oc get inferenceservice -n <namespace> <inferenceservice-name> -o json | jq '.spec.predictor.annotations'
----
+
You see the annotation that you added in the output:
+
[source]
----
{
  "prometheus.io/path": "/metrics",
  "prometheus.io/port": "8000"
}
