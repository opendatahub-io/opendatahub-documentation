= Getting started using the Ray template
Use the Ray retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) template to build scalable, high-performance applications. This end-to-end framework enables parallel processing of large datasets, which reduces the processing time and memory intensity required on a single machine.

.Prerequisites
* You have a data science project with an active workbench.
* Your workbench image includes the Feature Store.

.Procedure
. Apply the Ray RAG Template 
Run the following code for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications with distributed embedding generation:
`feast init -t ray_rag my_rag_project
cd my_rag_project/feature_repo`

Your Ray template is now active.
