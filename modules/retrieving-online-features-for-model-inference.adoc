= Retrieving online features for model inference

After your cluster administrator loads feature data to the online store, you can retrieve features for model training.

When the cluster administrator creates a `FeatureStore` CR, by default, it runs the online store feature server. This Python feature server is an HTTP endpoint that serves features with JSON I/O. You can write and read features from the online store by using any programming language that can make HTTP requests.

*Note:* You can also retrieve online features by using the Feast SDK as described in link:https://docs.feast.dev/getting-started/concepts/feature-retrieval#retrieving-online-features-for-model-inference[the upstream Feast documentation].

A feature service is an object that represents a logical group of features from one or more feature views. With a feature service, your ML models can access features from within a feature view as needed.

Typically, you create one feature service per model version, allowing for tracking of the features used by models. The features retrieved from the online store can belong to many feature views.

*Note:* When you apply a feature service, an actual feature store server is not deployed.

.Prerequisites

* In your IDE environment, you have installed the Feature Store Python SDK and added a `feature_store.yaml` file, as described in _Setting up your working environment_. 

* Your cluster administrator has pushed feature data to the online store.

* Optionally, you have cloned a Git repository that includes your model training code.

.Procedure

. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Data science projects*. 
. Click the name of the project and then click the *Workbenches* tab.
. Click the open icon (image:images/open.png[The open icon]) next to the workbench.
. In a Python notebook cell, run the following command to instantiate a local FeatureStore object that can parse the feature registry:
+
[.lines_space]
[source, python]
----
from feast import FeatureStore

feature_store = FeatureStore('.')
----

. Identify the feature service:
+
[.lines_space]
[source, python]
----
feature_service = feature_store.get_feature_service("credit_activity")
----

. Retrieve features from the online store by using the `get_online_features` method:
+
[.lines_space]
[source, python]
----
features = feature_store.get_online_features(
features=feature_service,
    entity_rows=[
        # {join_key: entity_value}
        {"dob_ssn": 19530219_5179},
        {"dob_ssn": 19500806_6783},
    ]
)
----

.Verification

When you run the `feast` commands, you should see output similar to the following"

.Example output
----
{
 'credit_card_due': [833,1297],
 'bankruptcies': [0, 1],
 'dob_ssn': [19530219_5179, 19500806_6783]
}
----

.Next step

* See the following Git repositories for an example of how to use features to train a model.
