= Support philosophy: A secure platform

Our primary goal is to provide a secure and reliable platform for serving and customizing models on {productname-long}.

The Python packages for model customization (such as `docling`, `sdg-hub`, and `training-hub`) are key components of this platform.

Our support strategy is focused on the integrity of the platform and the secure delivery of these tools, rather than providing direct, standalone support for the individual Python packages themselves.

*What is supported*

* *Installation on {productname-short}:* We fully support the successful installation of these packages from the {org-name} AI Python Index onto a supported {productname-long} environment when you use the provided base images.

* *The Platform:* The underlying {productname-long} platform, including its components and infrastructure, is fully supported according to its own lifecycle policy.

*What is not supported*

* Issues arising from the use of these packages, for example, to build custom flows or applications.

* Mixing packages outside of the packages provided with the {org-name} AI Python Index base images.

The primary benefit of this strategy is a secure software supply chain. By using the {org-name} AI Python Index, you are guaranteed:

* *{org-name} Builds:* You are using {org-name} builds of Python libraries built and delivered by {org-name} and our partners. These builds ensure provenance because {org-name} pulls, scans, and builds all dependencies for the packages. 

* *Trusted Source:* The index provides a trusted, secure, and reliable source for your generative AI workflows, especially critical for disconnected (air-gapped) environments.

* *Platform Integrity:* You can be confident that the tools are tested and intended for use on the {productname-long} platform.

For deeper technical questions or contributions related to the packages themselves, we encourage users to engage with the upstream open-source communities.
