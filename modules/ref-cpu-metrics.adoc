[role='_abstract']
You can track metrics on your CPU to ensure the health of the hardware.

CPU utilization::
--
Tracks CPU usage to identify workloads that are CPU-bound.

CPU-GPU bottlenecks::
--
A combination of CPU throttling and GPU usage metrics to identify resource allocation inefficiencies. The following table outlines the combination of CPU throttling and GPU utilizations, and what these metrics mean for your environment:

[cols="1,1,1"] 
|===
| CPU throttling | GPU utilization | Meaning

| Low 
| High 
| System well-balanced. GPU is fully used without CPU constraints.

| High 
| Low 
| CPU resources are constrained. The CPU is unable to keep up with the GPU's processing demands, and the GPU may be underused.

| High 
| High 
| Workload is increasing for both CPU and GPU, and you might need to scale up resources.
