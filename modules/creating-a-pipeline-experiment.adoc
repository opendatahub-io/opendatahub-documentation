[role='_abstract']
Pipeline experiments are workspaces where you can try different configurations of your pipelines. You can also use experiments to organize your pipeline runs into logical groups. Pipeline experiments contain pipeline runs, including recurring runs.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
* You have previously created a data science project that is available and contains a configured pipeline server.
* You have imported a pipeline to an active pipeline server.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Experiments* -> *Experiments and runs*.
. On the *Experiments* page, from the *Project* drop-down list, select the project to create the pipeline experiment in.
. Click *Create experiment*.
. In the *Create experiment* dialog, configure the pipeline experiment:
.. In the *Experiment name* field, enter a name for the pipeline experiment.
.. In the *Description* field, enter a description for the pipeline experiment.
.. Click *Create experiment*.

.Verification
* The pipeline experiment that you created appears on the *Experiments* tab.
