Before configuring a GenAI Playground, you must complete the following tasks:

. Create a project.
** The playground instance is tied to a project context. 
ifndef::upstream[]
** For more information, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/using-data-science-projects_projects#creating-a-data-science-project_projects[Creating a data science project]. 
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
** For more information, see link:{odhdocshome}/working-on-data-science-projects/#creating-a-data-science-project_projects[Creating a data science project]. 
endif::[]

. Add a connection to your project. 
ifdef::upstream[]
** For more information about creating connections, see link:{odhdocshome}/working-on-data-science-projects/#adding-a-connection-to-your-data-science-project_projects[Adding a connection to your data science project].
endif::[]

** For more information about creating connections, see link:{rhoaidocshome}/html/working_on_data_science_projects/using-connections_projects#adding-a-connection-to-your-data-science-project_projects[Adding a connection to your data science project]. 
endif::[]

. Deploy a model in your project and make it available as an AI asset endpoint.
ifdef::upstream[]
** For more information, see link:{odhdocshome}/deploying_models/#deploying-models-on-the-single-model-serving-platform_odh-user[Deploying models on the single-model serving platform^].
endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
* For more information, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/deploying_models/deploying_models_on_the_single_model_serving_platform#deploying-models-on-the-single-model-serving-platform_rhoai-user[Deploying models on the single-model serving platform^].
endif::[]

. Configure MCP server connections.
** To test models with external tools, you must configure any Model Control Protocol (MCP) servers.

After you complete these tasks, the project is ready for you to configure your playground instance.
