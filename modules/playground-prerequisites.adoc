Before you can configure and use the GenAI playground feature, you must meet prerequisites at both the cluster and user levels.

== Cluster administrator prerequisites

Before a user can configure a playground instance, a cluster administrator must complete the following setup tasks:

* Ensure that {productname-short} is installed on an OpenShift cluster running version 4.17 or later.

* Set the value of the `spec.dashboardConfig.genAiStudio` dashboard configuration option to `true`. For more information, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/managing_resources/customizing-the-dashboard#ref-dashboard-configuration-options_dashboard[Dashboard configuration options].  
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* Set the value of the `spec.dashboardConfig.genAiStudio` dashboard configuration option to `true`. For more information, see link:{odhdocshome}/managing-resources/#ref-dashboard-configuration-options_dashboard[Dashboard configuration options].
endif::[]
* If using {productname-short} groups, add users to the  {user-group} and {admin-group} OpenShift group.
* Install the Llama Stack Operator.
* Configure a `LlamaStackDistribution` custom resource (CR) with a vLLM inference service and a vector store.
* Configure network access to the vector database service within the {productname-short) environment using the OpenShift console.

== User prerequisites

After the cluster administrator completes the setup, you must complete the following tasks before you can configure your playground instance:

* You are logged in to {productname-short}.
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are a member of the appropriate user or admin group.
* Create a project. The playground instance is tied to a project context.

* Add a connection to your project.

* Deploy a model in your project and make it available as an AI asset endpoint.
ifdef::upstream[]
** For more information, see link:{odhdocshome}/deploying_models/#deploying-models-on-the-single-model-serving-platform_odh-user[Deploying models on the single-model serving platform^].

endif::[]

* Configure MCP server connections.
** To test models with external tools, you must configure any Model Control Protocol (MCP) servers.

After you complete these tasks, the project is ready for you to configure your playground instance.
