. Deploy a model as an AI asset in your project.
** After a model is deployed, you must make it an available AI asset.
. Configure MCP server connections.
** To test models with external tools, you must configure any Model Control Plane (MCP) servers.

After you complete these tasks, the project is ready for you to configure your playground instance.
