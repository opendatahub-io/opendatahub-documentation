= Troubleshooting DSPA component errors

[role='_abstract']
This table displays common errors found in DataSciencePipelinesApplication (DSPA) components, along with their statuses, messages, and proposed solutions. The **Ready** condition type accumulates errors from various DSPA components, providing a status view of the DSPA deployment.

|`ObjectStorageAvailable`

Ready
|False

False
|`Could not connect to Object Store: tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`
|This issue occurs in clusters that use self-signed certificates with {productname-short} version 2.9 or later. The data science pipelines manager cannot connect to the object storage as it does not trust the object storage SSL certificate. Therefore, the pipeline server cannot be created. 

Contact your IT operations administrator to add the relevant Certificate Authority bundle.

|`ObjectStorageAvailable`

Ready
|False

False
|`Could not connect to Object Store
Deployment for component "ds-pipeline-pipelines-definition" is missing - prerequisite component might not yet be available.
Deployment for component "ds-pipeline-persistenceagent-pipelines-definition" is missing - prerequisite component might not yet be available.
Deployment for component "ds-pipeline-scheduledworkflow-pipelines-definition" is missing - prerequisite component might not yet be available.`
|In clusters running {productname-short} 2.8.x, the data science pipelines manager might fail to connect to the object storage, and the pipeline server might not be created. 

Ensure that your object store credentials and connection information are accurate, and verify that the object store is accessible from within the data science project's associated OpenShift namespace. One common issue is that the object storage SSL certificate is not trusted, particularly if self-signed certificates are used.

Verify and update your object storage credentials, then retry the operation.

|`ObjectStorageAvailable`

Ready
|False

False
|`Wrong credentials for Object Storage: Could not connect to (minio-my-project.apps.my-cluster.com), Error: The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided. Check your key and signing method.`
|Provide the correct credentials for your object storage and retry the operation.

|`DatabaseAvailable`

Ready
|False

False
|`FailingToDeploy: Dial tcp XXX.XX.XXX.XXX:3306 : i/o timeout`
|If the issue persists beyond startup, check for network issues or misconfigurations in the database connection settings.

|`DatabaseAvailable`

Ready
|False

False
|`Unable to connect to external database: tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`
|This issue can occur when you use any external database, such as Amazon RDS. The data science pipelines manager cannot connect to the database because it does not trust the database SSL certificate, preventing the creation of the pipeline server.  Contact your IT operations administrator to add the relevant certificates.

|`DatabaseAvailable`

Ready
|False

False
|`Error 1129: Host 'A.B.C.D' is blocked because of many connection errors.`
| This issue can occur when you use any external database, such as Amazon RDS. The data science pipelines manager cannot connect to the database because it does not trust the database SSL certificate, preventing the creation of the pipeline server.  Contact your IT operations administrator to add the relevant certificates.

For more information on how resolve this issue for an external Amazon RDS database, see link:https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/rds-blocked-host-error[Resolving "Host is blocked because of many connection errors" error in Amazon RDS for MySQL].

|`APIServerReady`

Ready
|False

False
|`Route creation failed due to lengthy project name: Route.route.openshift.io is invalid: spec.host exceeds 63 characters.`
|Ensure that the project name in OpenShift is less than 40 characters.

|`APIServerReady`

Ready
|False

False
|`FailingToDeploy: Component replica failed to create. Message: serviceaccount "ds-pipeline-sample" not found.`
|If the failure persists for more than 25 seconds during DSPA startup, recreate the missing service account.

|`PersistenceAgentReady`

Ready
|False

False
|`FailingToDeploy: Component's replica failed to create. Message: serviceaccount "ds-pipeline-persistenceagent-sample" not found.`
|If the failure persists for more than 25 seconds during DSPA startup, recreate the missing service account.

|`ScheduledWorkflowReady`

Ready
|False

False
|`FailingToDeploy: Component's replica failed to create. Message: serviceaccount "ds-pipeline-scheduledworkflow-sample" not found.`
|If the failure persists for more than 25 seconds during DSPA startup, recreate the missing service account

|`MLMDProxyReady`

Ready
|False

False
|`Deploying: Component [ds-pipeline-scheduledworkflow-sample] is still deploying.`
|Wait for DSPA startup to complete. If deployment fails after 25 seconds, check the logs for further information.

== Common errors across DSP components

The following table lists errors that might occur across multiple DSPA components:

[cols="1,1,1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Deployment condition |Condition type |Status |Error message |Solution
|Component Deployment Not Found
|`ComponentDeploymentNotFound`
|False
|`Deployment for component `<component>` is missing - prerequisite component may not yet be available.`
|The deployment for the component does not exist. Typically, this is due to missing deployments or issues that occurred during creation.

|Deployment Scaled Down
|`MinimumReplicasAvailable`
|False
|`Deployment for component `<component>` is scaled down.`
|The component is unavailable as the deployment replica count is set to zero.

|Component Failing to Progress
|`FailingToDeploy`
|False
|`Component `<component>` has failed to progress. Reason: `<progressingCond.Reason>`. Message: `<progressingCond.Message>``
|The deployment has stalled due to "ProgressDeadlineExceeded" or `ReplicaSetCreateError` issues, or similar.

|Replica Creation Failure
|`FailingToDeploy`
|False
|Component's replica `<component>` has failed to create. Reason: `<replicaFailureCond.Reason>`. Message: `<replicaFailureCond.Message>`
|Replica creation has failed, typically due to an error in the replica set or with the service accounts.

|Pod-Level Failures
|`FailingToDeploy`
|False
|`Concatenated failure messages for each pod.`
|Deployment pods are in a failed state. Check the pod logs for further information.

|Pod in CrashLoopBackOff
|`FailingToDeploy`
|False
|`Component `<component>` is in CrashLoopBackOff. Message from pod: `<crashLoopBackOffMessage>``
|Pod containers are failing repeatedly, often due to incorrect environment variables or missing service accounts.

|Component Deploying (No Errors)
|`Deploying`
|False
|`Component `<component>` is deploying.`
|The component deployment process is ongoing with no errors detected.

|Component Minimally Available
|`MinimumReplicasAvailable`
|True
|Component `<component>` is minimally available.`
|The component is available, but only with the minimum number of replicas running.
