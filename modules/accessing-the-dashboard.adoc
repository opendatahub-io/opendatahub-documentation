. Right-click *{productname-long}* and copy the URL for your {productname-short} instance.
. Provide this instance URL to your data scientists to let them log in to {productname-short}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Upgrading from {productname-short} version 2.x to 3.3 changes the dashboard URL format. The cluster administrator must provide the new dashboard URL to all {productname-long} administrators and users. The previous dashboard URL format is no longer functional.
