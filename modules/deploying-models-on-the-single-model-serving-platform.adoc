= Deploying models on the single-model serving platform

[role='_abstract']

When you have enabled the single-model serving platform, you can enable a preinstalled or custom model-serving runtime and deploy models on the platform.

ifdef::upstream[]
You can use preinstalled model-serving runtimes to start serving models without modifying or defining the runtime yourself. For help adding a custom runtime, see link:{odhdocshome}/serving-models/#adding-a-custom-model-serving-runtime-for-the-single-model-serving-platform_serving-large-models[Adding a custom model-serving runtime for the single-model serving platform].

.Procedure
. In the left menu, click *Data science projects*.
+
The *Data science projects* page opens.
. Click the name of the project that you want to deploy a model in.
+
A project details page opens.
. Click the *Models* tab.
. Perform one of the following actions:
+
--
* If you see a *​​Single-model serving platform* tile, click *Deploy model* on the tile.
* If you do not see any tiles, click the *Deploy model* button.
--
+
The *Deploy model* dialog opens.

. In the *Model deployment name* field, enter a unique name for the model that you are deploying.
. In the *Serving runtime* field, select an enabled runtime.
If project-scoped runtimes exist, the *Serving runtime* list includes subheadings to distinguish between global runtimes and project-scoped runtimes.
. From the *Model framework (name - version)* list, select a value.
ifndef::upstream[]
. From the **Deployment mode** list, select standard or advanced. For more information about deployment modes, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/serving_models/serving-large-models_serving-large-models#about-kserve-deployment-modes_serving-large-models[About KServe deployment modes].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
. From the **Deployment mode** list, select standard or advanced. For more information about deployment modes, see link:{odhdocshome}/serving-models/#about-kserve-deployment-modes_serving-large-models[About KServe deployment modes].
endif::[]
. In the *Number of model server replicas to deploy* field, specify a value.
. The following options are only available if you have created a hardware profile:
.. From the *Hardware profile* list, select a hardware profile.
If project-scoped hardware profiles exist, the *Hardware profile* list includes subheadings to distinguish between global hardware profiles and project-scoped hardware profiles.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
By default, hardware profiles are hidden in the dashboard navigation menu and user interface, while accelerator profiles remain visible. In addition, user interface components associated with the deprecated accelerator profiles functionality are still displayed. If you enable hardware profiles, the *Hardware profiles* list is displayed instead of the *Accelerator profiles* list. To show the *Settings -> Hardware profiles* option in the dashboard navigation menu, and the user interface components associated with hardware profiles, set the `disableHardwareProfiles` value to `false` in the `OdhDashboardConfig` custom resource (CR) in {openshift-platform}.

.. Optional To change these default values, click *Customize resource requests and limit* and enter new minimum (request) and maximum (limit) values. The hardware profile specifies the number of CPUs and the amount of memory allocated to the container, setting the guaranteed minimum (request) and maximum (limit) for both. 
. Optional: In the *Model route* section, select the *Make deployed models available through an external route* checkbox to make your deployed models available to external clients.
. To require token authentication for inference requests to the deployed model, perform the following actions:
.. Select *Require token authentication*.
.. In the *Service account name* field, enter the service account name that the token will be generated for.
.. To add an additional service account, click *Add a service account* and enter another service account name.
. To specify the location of your model, perform one of the following sets of actions:
+
--
* *To use an existing connection*
.. Select *Existing connection*.
.. From the *Name* list, select a connection that you previously defined.
... *For S3-compatible object storage*: In the *Path* field, enter the folder path that contains the model in your specified data source.
ifdef::self-managed,cloud-service[]
+
IMPORTANT: The OpenVINO Model Server runtime has specific requirements for how you specify the model path. For more information, see known issue link:{rhoaidocshome}html-single/release_notes/index#known-issues_RHOAIENG-3025_relnotes[RHOAIENG-3025] in the {productname-short} release notes.
endif::[]
... *For Open Container Image connections*: In the *OCI storage location* field, enter the model URI where the model is located.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are deploying a registered model version with an existing S3, URI, or OCI data connection, some of your connection details might be autofilled. This depends on the type of data connection and the number of matching connections available in your data science project. For example, if only one matching connection exists, fields like the path, URI, endpoint, model URI, bucket, and region might populate automatically. Matching connections will be labeled as **Recommended**.
====

* *To use a new connection* 
... To define a new connection that your model can access, select *New connection*.
+
. In the *Add connection* modal, select a *Connection type*. The *OCI-compliant registry*, *S3 compatible object storage*, and *URI* options are pre-installed connection types. Additional options might be available if your {productname-short} administrator added them.
+
The *Add connection* form opens with fields specific to the connection type that you selected.
... Fill in the connection detail fields.
ifdef::self-managed,cloud-service[]
+
IMPORTANT: If your connection type is an S3-compatible object storage, you must provide the folder path that contains your data file. The OpenVINO Model Server runtime has specific requirements for how you specify the model path. For more information, see known issue link:{rhoaidocshome}html-single/release_notes/index#known-issues_RHOAIENG-3025_relnotes[RHOAIENG-3025] in the {productname-short} release notes.

--
. (Optional) Customize the runtime parameters in the *Configuration parameters* section:
.. Modify the values in *Additional serving runtime arguments* to define how the deployed model behaves.
.. Modify the values in *Additional environment variables* to define variables in the model's environment.
+
The *Configuration parameters* section shows predefined serving runtime parameters, if any are available.
+
NOTE: Do not modify the port or model serving runtime arguments, because they require specific values to be set. Overwriting these parameters can cause the deployment to fail.
+
. Click *Deploy*.

.Verification
* Confirm that the deployed model is shown on the *Models* tab for the project, and on the *Model deployments* page of the dashboard with a checkmark in the *Status* column.
