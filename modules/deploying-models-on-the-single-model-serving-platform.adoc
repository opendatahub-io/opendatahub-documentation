= Deploying models on the single-model serving platform

[role='_abstract']
When you have enabled the single-model serving platform, you can enable a preinstalled or custom model-serving runtime and start to deploy models on the platform.

NOTE: link:https://github.com/IBM/text-generation-inference[Text Generation Inference Server (TGIS)^] is based on an early fork of link:https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference[Hugging Face TGI^]. Red Hat will continue to develop the standalone TGIS runtime to support TGI models. If a model does not work in the current version of {productname-short}, support might be added in a future version. In the meantime, you can also add your own, custom runtime to support a TGI model. For more information, see link:{odhdocshome}/serving-models/#adding-a-custom-model-serving-runtime-for-the-single-model-serving-platform_serving-large-models[Adding a custom model-serving runtime for the single-model serving platform].

* If you do not see any tiles, click the *Deploy model* button.
--
+

+
. In the *Add connection* modal, select a *Connection type*. The *S3 compatible object storage* and *URI* options are pre-installed connection types. Additional options might be available if your {productname-short} administrator added them.
+
The *Add connection* form opens with fields specific to the connection type that you selected.
... Fill in the connection detail fields.
ifdef::self-managed,cloud-service[]
+
IMPORTANT: If your connection type is an S3-compatible object storage, you must provide the folder path that contains your data file. The OpenVINO Model Server runtime has specific requirements for how you specify the model path. For more information, see known issue link:{rhoaidocshome}html-single/release_notes/index#known-issues_RHOAIENG-3025_relnotes[RHOAIENG-3025] in the {productname-short} release notes.
endif::[]
--
. (Optional) Customize the runtime parameters in the *Configuration parameters* section:
.. Modify the values in *Additional serving runtime arguments* to define how the deployed model behaves.
.. Modify the values in *Additional environment variables* to define variables in the model's environment.
+
The *Configuration parameters* section shows predefined serving runtime parameters, if any are available.
+
NOTE: Do not modify the port or model serving runtime arguments, because they require specific values to be set. Overwriting these parameters can cause the deployment to fail.
+
. Click *Deploy*.

.Verification
* Confirm that the deployed model is shown on the *Models* tab for the project, and on the *Model Serving* page of the dashboard with a checkmark in the *Status* column.
