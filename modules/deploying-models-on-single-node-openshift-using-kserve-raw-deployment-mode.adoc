= Deploying models on single node {openshift-platform} using KServe raw deployment mode

// [Em] - This topic has been removed with the GA of KServe raw in the dashboard. See https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHOAIENG-20955  

[role='_abstract']

You can deploy a machine learning model on single node {openshift-platform} by using standard deployment mode, which is based on KServe RawDeployment mode. Standard mode offers several advantages over advanced, such as the ability to mount multiple volumes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Deploying a machine learning model using KServe standard deployment mode on single node OpenShift is a Limited Availability feature. Limited Availability means that you can install and receive support for the feature only with specific approval from the {org-name} AI Business Unit. Without such approval, the feature is unsupported.
====

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
* You have cluster administrator privileges for your {openshift-platform} cluster.
* You have created an {openshift-platform} cluster that has a node with at least 4 CPUs and 16 GB memory.
* You have installed the {productname-long} (RHOAI) Operator.
* You have installed the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI). For more information about installing the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI), see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#cli-getting-started[Getting started with the OpenShift CLI].
* You have installed KServe.
* You have enabled the single-model serving platform in standard deployment mode.
* You have access to S3-compatible object storage.
* For the model that you want to deploy, you know the associated folder path in your S3-compatible object storage bucket.
* To use the Caikit-TGIS runtime, you have converted your model to Caikit format. For an example, see link:https://github.com/opendatahub-io/caikit-tgis-serving/blob/main/demo/kserve/built-tip.md#bootstrap-process[Converting Hugging Face Hub models to Caikit format^] in the link:https://github.com/opendatahub-io/caikit-tgis-serving/tree/main[caikit-tgis-serving^] repository.

* If you want to use graphics processing units (GPUs) with your model server, you have enabled GPU support in {productname-short}. If you use NVIDIA GPUs, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/managing_openshift_ai/enabling_accelerators#enabling-nvidia-gpus_managing-rhoai[Enabling NVIDIA GPUs^]. If you use AMD GPUs, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/managing_openshift_ai/enabling_accelerators#amd-gpu-integration_managing-rhoai[AMD GPU integration^].
* To use the vLLM runtime, you have enabled GPU support in {productname-short} and have installed and configured the Node Feature Discovery operator on your cluster. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/specialized_hardware_and_driver_enablement/psap-node-feature-discovery-operator#installing-the-node-feature-discovery-operator_psap-node-feature-discovery-operator[Installing the Node Feature Discovery operator] and link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/managing_openshift_ai/enabling_accelerators#enabling-nvidia-gpus_managing-rhoai[Enabling NVIDIA GPUs].

.Procedure
. Open a command-line terminal and log in to your {openshift-platform} cluster as cluster administrator:
+
[source]
----
$ oc login <openshift_cluster_url> -u <admin_username> -p <password>
----

. By default, {openshift-platform} uses a service mesh for network traffic management. Because KServe raw deployment mode does not require a service mesh, disable {org-name} {openshift-platform} Service Mesh:
.. Enter the following command to disable {org-name} {openshift-platform} Service Mesh:
+
[source]
----
$ oc edit dsci -n redhat-ods-operator
----
.. In the YAML editor, change the value of `managementState` for the `serviceMesh` component to `Removed` as shown:
+
[source]
----
spec:
  components:
    serviceMesh:
      managementState: Removed
----
.. Save the changes.
. Create a project:
+
[source]
----
$ oc new-project <project_name> --description="<description>" --display-name="<display_name>"
----
For information about creating projects, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/building_applications/projects#working-with-projects[Working with projects].

. Create a data science cluster:
.. In the {org-name} {openshift-platform} web console *Administrator* view, click *Operators* â†’ *Installed Operators* and then click the {productname-long} Operator.
.. Click the *Data Science Cluster* tab.
.. Click the *Create DataScienceCluster* button.
.. In the *Configure via* field, click the *YAML view* radio button.
.. In the `spec.components` section of the YAML editor, configure the `kserve` component as shown:
+
[source]
----
  kserve:
    defaultDeploymentMode: RawDeployment
    rawDeploymentServiceConfig: Headed
    managementState: Managed
    serving:
      managementState: Removed
      name: knative-serving
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The configuration shown uses `Headed` configuration for handling load balancing requests, which does not require a dedicated load balancer. For environments that have a dedicated load balancer to handle requests from outside the cluster, set `rawDeploymentServiceConfig` to `Headless`.
====
+
.. Click *Create*.
+
. Create a secret file: 
.. At your command-line terminal, create a YAML file to contain your secret and add the following YAML code:
+
[source]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  annotations:
    serving.kserve.io/s3-endpoint: <AWS_ENDPOINT>
    serving.kserve.io/s3-usehttps: "1"
    serving.kserve.io/s3-region: <AWS_REGION>
    serving.kserve.io/s3-useanoncredential: "false"
  name: <Secret-name>
stringData:
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>"
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>"
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are deploying a machine learning model in a disconnected deployment, add `serving.kserve.io/s3-verifyssl: '0'` to the `metadata.annotations` section.
====
.. Save the file with the file name *secret.yaml*.
.. Apply the *secret.yaml* file:
+
[source]
----
$ oc apply -f secret.yaml -n <namespace>
----
. Create a service account: 
.. Create a YAML file to contain your service account and add the following YAML code:
+
[source]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: models-bucket-sa
secrets:
- name: s3creds
----
For information about service accounts, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/authentication_and_authorization/understanding-and-creating-service-accounts[Understanding and creating service accounts].
.. Save the file with the file name *serviceAccount.yaml*.
.. Apply the *serviceAccount.yaml* file:
+
[source]
----
$ oc apply -f serviceAccount.yaml -n <namespace>
----

. Create a YAML file for the serving runtime to define the container image that will serve your model predictions. Here is an example using the OpenVino Model Server:
+
[source]
----
apiVersion: serving.kserve.io/v1alpha1
kind: ServingRuntime
metadata:
  name: ovms-runtime
spec:
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/path: /metrics
    prometheus.io/port: "8888"
  containers:
    - args:
        - --model_name={{.Name}}
        - --port=8001
        - --rest_port=8888
        - --model_path=/mnt/models
        - --file_system_poll_wait_seconds=0
        - --grpc_bind_address=0.0.0.0
        - --rest_bind_address=0.0.0.0
        - --target_device=AUTO
        - --metrics_enable
      image: quay.io/modh/openvino_model_server@sha256:6c7795279f9075bebfcd9aecbb4a4ce4177eec41fb3f3e1f1079ce6309b7ae45
      name: kserve-container
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8888
          protocol: TCP
  multiModel: false
  protocolVersions:
    - v2
    - grpc-v2
  supportedModelFormats:
    - autoSelect: true
      name: openvino_ir
      version: opset13
    - name: onnx
      version: "1"
    - autoSelect: true
      name: tensorflow
      version: "1"
    - autoSelect: true
      name: tensorflow
      version: "2"
    - autoSelect: true
      name: paddle
      version: "2"
    - autoSelect: true
      name: pytorch
      version: "2"
----

.. If you are using the OpenVINO Model Server example above, ensure that you insert the correct values required for any placeholders in the YAML code.
.. Save the file with an appropriate file name.
.. Apply the file containing your serving run time:
+
[source]
----
$ oc apply -f <serving run time file name> -n <namespace>
----

. Create an InferenceService custom resource (CR). Create a YAML file to contain the InferenceService CR. Using the OpenVINO Model Server example used previously, here is the corresponding YAML code:

+
[source]
----
apiVersion: serving.kserve.io/v1beta1
kind: InferenceService
metadata:
  annotations:
    serving.knative.openshift.io/enablePassthrough: "true"
    sidecar.istio.io/inject: "true"
    sidecar.istio.io/rewriteAppHTTPProbers: "true"
    serving.kserve.io/deploymentMode: RawDeployment
  name: <InferenceService-Name>
spec:
  predictor:
    scaleMetric:
    minReplicas: 1
    scaleTarget:
    canaryTrafficPercent:
    serviceAccountName: <serviceAccountName>
    model:
      env: []
      volumeMounts: []
      modelFormat:
        name: onnx
      runtime: ovms-runtime
      storageUri: s3://<bucket_name>/<model_directory_path>
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: 5Gi
    volumes: []
----

.. In your YAML code, ensure the following values are set correctly:

* `serving.kserve.io/deploymentMode` must contain the value `RawDeployment`.
* `modelFormat` must contain the value for your model format, such as `onnx`.
* `storageUri` must contain the value for your model s3 storage directory, for example `s3://<bucket_name>/<model_directory_path>`.
* `runtime` must contain the value for the name of your serving runtime, for example, `ovms-runtime`.

.. Save the file with an appropriate file name.
.. Apply the file containing your InferenceService CR:
+
[source]
----
$ oc apply -f <InferenceService CR file name> -n <namespace>
----

. Verify that all pods are running in your cluster:

+
[source]
----
$ oc get pods -n <namespace>
----
Example output:

+
[source]
----
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE 
<isvc_name>-predictor-xxxxx-2mr5l 1/1 Running 2 165m
console-698d866b78-m87pm 1/1 Running 2 165m
----

. After you verify that all pods are running, forward the service port to your local machine:

+
[source]
----
$ oc -n <namespace> port-forward pod/<pod-name> <local_port>:<remote_port>
----
Ensure that you replace `<namespace>`, `<pod-name>`, `<local_port>`, `<remote_port>` (this is the model server port, for example, `8888`) with values appropriate to your deployment.


.Verification
* Use your preferred client library or tool to send requests to the `localhost` inference URL.
