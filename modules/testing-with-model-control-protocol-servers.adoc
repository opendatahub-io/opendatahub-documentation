= Testing with model context protocol (MCP) servers

[role="_abstract"]

Authorize and interact with connected MCP servers to use their integrated tools directly from the playground chat.

.Prerequisites

* You have deployed a model with tool-calling capabilities enabled in your project.
* You have configured a playground instance for your project.
* A cluster administrator has configured an MCP server, and the server is listed and available in the *MCP servers* section of your playground.

.Procedure

. In the *MCP servers* section, select the checkbox for the server that you want to use.
. Click the *Auth* icon next to the server name.
+
The *Authorize MCP server* dialog opens.
. If the server requires a token, enter the token in the *Access token* field and click *Authorize*.
+
A *Connection successful* message appears.
+
[NOTE]
====
Authorization tokens for MCP servers are stored only for the current browser session. If you close your browser, you must re-authorize the server.
====
. Click *Close*.
. Click the *View tools* (wrench) icon for the same MCP server.
+
A modal appears, listing all available tools for that server. You can copy a tool name to use in the chat.
. In the chat input field, type a query that uses one of the available tools.
. Click the *Send* button or press Enter.
+
*NOTE:* After you send a prompt, the *Send* button in the chat input field changes to a *Stop* button. Click it if you want to interrupt the model's response, for example, when the response takes longer than you anticipated or if you notice that you made an error in your prompt. The Bot posts “You stopped this message” to confirm your stop request.

.Verification

* The AI bot responds, indicating it is using the tool.
* The bot provides the output from the tool.
