[IMPORTANT]
====
Accelerator profiles are now deprecated. To target specific worker nodes for workbenches or model serving workloads, use hardware profiles. By default, the accelerator profiles feature is still displayed in the dashboard navigation menu, while the hardware profiles feature is hidden. 

To disable accelerator profiles in the dashboard navigation menu, set the `disableAcceleratorProfiles` value to `true` in the `OdhDashboardConfig` Custom Resource (CR) in {openshift-platform}. To enable hardware profiles, set the `disableHardwareProfiles` value to `false` in the same CR.

*Note:* The `spec.dashboardConfig.disableAcceleratorProfiles` option is superseded by the `spec.dashboardConfig.disableHardwareProfiles` option. If both options are set to `false`, the `disableHardwareProfiles` option overrides the `disableAcceleratorProfiles` option, and the *Settings â†’ Hardware profiles* menu item is shown in the dashboard navigation menu.

{org-name} recommends that you migrate any existing accelerator profiles to hardware profiles as soon as possible to ensure continued support and compatibility.
====
To configure accelerators for your data scientists to use in {productname-short}, you must create an associated accelerator profile. An accelerator profile is a custom resource definition (CRD) on OpenShift that has an AcceleratorProfile resource, and defines the specification of the accelerator. You can create and manage accelerator profiles by selecting *Settings* -> *Environment setup* -> *Hardware profiles* on the {productname-short} dashboard.

For accelerators that are new to your deployment, you must manually configure an accelerator profile for each accelerator. If your deployment contains an accelerator before you upgrade, the associated accelerator profile remains after the upgrade. You can manage the accelerators that appear to your data scientists by assigning specific accelerator profiles to your custom workbench images. This example shows the code for a Habana Gaudi 1 accelerator profile:
[source,yaml]
---
apiVersion: dashboard.opendatahub.io/v1alpha
kind: AcceleratorProfile
metadata:
  name: hpu-profile-first-gen-gaudi
spec:
  displayName: Habana HPU - 1st Gen Gaudi
  description: First Generation Habana Gaudi device
  enabled: true
  identifier: habana.ai/gaudi
  tolerations:
    - effect: NoSchedule
      key: habana.ai/gaudi
      operator: Exists
---

The accelerator profile code is displayed on the *Instances* tab on the details page for the `AcceleratorProfile` custom resource definition (CRD). For more information about accelerator profile attributes, see the following table:

.Accelerator profile attributes
[cols="1,1,1,5",header]
|===
| Attribute | Type | Required | Description  

| displayName
| String
| Required
| The display name of the accelerator profile.

| description
| String
| Optional
| Descriptive text defining the accelerator profile.

| identifier
| String
