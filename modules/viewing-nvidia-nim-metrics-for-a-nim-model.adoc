= Viewing NVIDIA NIM metrics for a NIM model

[role='_abstract']

In {productname-short}, you can observe the following NVIDIA NIM metrics for a NIM model deployed on the NVIDIA NIM model serving platform:

* *GPU cache usage over time (ms)*
* *Current running, waiting, and max requests count*
* *Tokens count*
* *Time to first token*
* *Time per output token*
* *Request outcomes*

You can specify a time range and a refresh interval for these metrics to help you determine, for example, the peak usage hours and model performance at a specified time.

.Prerequisites

* You have enabled the NVIDIA NIM model serving platform.
* You have deployed a NIM model on the NVIDIA NIM model serving platform.

.Procedure

. From the {productname-short} dashboard navigation menu, click *Data science projects*.
+
The *Data science projects* page opens.
. Click the name of the project that contains the NIM model that you want to monitor.

. In the project details page, click the *Models* tab.

. Click the NIM model that you want to observe.

. On the *NIM Metrics* tab, set the following options:

** *Time range* - Specifies how long to track the metrics. You can select one of these values: 1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days.

** *Refresh interval* - Specifies how frequently the graphs on the metrics page are refreshed (to show the latest data). You can select one of these values: 15 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 1 day.

. Scroll down to view data graphs for NIM metrics.

.Verification

The *NIM Metrics* tab shows graphs of NIM metrics for the deployed NIM model.
