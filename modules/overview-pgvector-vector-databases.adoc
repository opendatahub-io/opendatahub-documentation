[role="_abstract"]
pgvector is an open source PostgreSQL extension that enables vector similarity search on embedding data stored in relational tables. In {productname-short}, PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension is supported as a remote vector database provider for the Llama Stack Operator, enabling retrieval augmented generation workflows that require persistent vector storage and integration with existing PostgreSQL environments.

pgvector vector databases provide the following capabilities in {productname-short}:

* Storage of vector embeddings in PostgreSQL tables
* Similarity search across embedding vectors by using pgvector distance metrics
* Persistent storage of vectors alongside relational data
* Integration with PostgreSQL security, access control, and operational tooling

In a typical retrieval augmented generation workflow in {productname-short}, your application uses the following components:

* *Inference provider*:  
Generates embeddings and produces responses by using a supported model deployment.

* *Vector store provider*:  
Stores embedding vectors and supports similarity search. When you use pgvector, PostgreSQL provides this capability as a remote vector store.

* *File storage provider*:  
Stores the original source files that are ingested into vector stores.

* *Llama Stack server*:  
Provides a unified API surface, including an OpenAI-compatible Vector Stores API.

When you ingest content, Llama Stack splits the source material into chunks, generates embeddings, and stores those embeddings in PostgreSQL through the pgvector extension. When you query a vector store, Llama Stack performs similarity search against the stored vectors and returns the most relevant chunks for use in application prompts.

In {productname-short}, pgvector is used in the following operational mode:

* *Remote PostgreSQL with pgvector*, which runs as a standalone PostgreSQL database service accessed by the Llama Stack server. This mode is suitable for development and production workloads that require persistent storage.

A remote PostgreSQL deployment with the pgvector extension typically includes the following components:

* *Secret* for PostgreSQL connection credentials.
* *Persistent storage* for durable database data.
* *PostgreSQL service* that exposes a network endpoint.

PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension does not require an external coordination service such as etcd. Vector data and related metadata are stored and managed directly in PostgreSQL tables.

Use remote PostgreSQL with pgvector when you require persistent vector storage and want to integrate retrieval augmented generation workloads with PostgreSQL-based data platforms. This option suits deployments that require durability, centralized management, and reuse of existing PostgreSQL operational practices.
