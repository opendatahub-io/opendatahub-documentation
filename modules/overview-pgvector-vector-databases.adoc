[role="_abstract"]
pgvector is an open source PostgreSQL extension that enables vector similarity search on embedding data stored in relational tables. In {productname-short}, PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension is supported as a *remote vector store provider* for Llama Stack, enabling retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workloads that require durable storage, transactional consistency, and integration with PostgreSQL-based platforms.

Starting with {productname-short} 3.2, PostgreSQL-based backends are the default and recommended option for production-grade Llama Stack deployments. When combined with pgvector, PostgreSQL provides a unified solution for both metadata persistence and vector similarity search.

pgvector vector databases provide the following capabilities in {productname-short}:

* Storage of vector embeddings in PostgreSQL tables
* Similarity search using pgvector distance metrics
* Durable and centralized persistence of vector data
* Integration with PostgreSQL security, access control, backup, and operational tooling

In a typical RAG workflow in {productname-short}, the following components work together:

* *Inference and embedding providers*  
  Generate embeddings and produce model responses.  
  In {productname-short} 3.2, remote embedding models are recommended for most deployments to ensure scalability and production readiness.

* *Vector store provider*  
  Stores embedding vectors and performs similarity search. When pgvector is enabled, PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension fulfills this role as a remote vector store.

* *File storage provider*  
  Stores the original source documents that are ingested into vector stores.

* *Llama Stack server*  
  Exposes a unified API surface, including an OpenAI-compatible Vector Stores API, and coordinates embedding generation, storage, and retrieval.

During ingestion, Llama Stack splits source documents into chunks, generates embeddings using the configured embedding model, and stores those embeddings in PostgreSQL through the pgvector extension. During query execution, Llama Stack performs similarity search against the stored vectors and supplies the most relevant chunks to the model as contextual input.

In {productname-short}, pgvector is supported in the following operational mode:

* *Remote PostgreSQL with pgvector*, where PostgreSQL runs as a standalone database service that is accessed by the Llama Stack server over the network.

A remote PostgreSQL deployment with the pgvector extension typically includes:

* A *Secret* containing PostgreSQL connection credentials
* *Persistent storage* for durable database data
* A *PostgreSQL Service* that exposes a network endpoint to the cluster

PostgreSQL with pgvector does not require an external coordination service such as etcd. Vector data and metadata are managed directly within PostgreSQL tables.

Use remote PostgreSQL with pgvector when you require production-ready persistence, centralized management, and close integration with PostgreSQL-based data platforms for retrieval-augmented generation workloads.
