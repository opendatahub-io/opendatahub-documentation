= Deploying teacher and judge models

[role='_abstract']
LAB-tuning in {productname-short} uses a teacher model to generate synthetic data and a judge model to evaluate the performance of the LAB-tuned model. 

You can deploy the models in the same cluster as the LAB-tuning process or in a different cluster. When you configure your LAB-tuning run, you provide the URL endpoints and authentication details for the teacher and judge models.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* Your cluster administrator has configured LAB-tuning in your cluster, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/enabling_lab-tuning/index[Enabling LAB-tuning].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* Your cluster administrator has configured LAB-tuning in your cluster, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/customizing-models-with-lab-tuning/#enabling-lab-tuning_lab-tuning[Enabling LAB-tuning].
endif::[]
* You have created a data science project and configured its pipeline server.
* For the teacher model (link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/rhelai1/modelcar-mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0-1/67922f1e167e94db874af7ab[rhelai1/modelcar-mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0-1:1.4]), the {openshift-platform} cluster has a worker node with 1 or multiple GPUs capable of running the model (for example, a2-ultragpu-4g, which contains 4 x NVIDIA A100 with 80GB vRAM) and has at least 100 GiB of available disk storage to store the model.
* For the judge model (link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/rhelai1/modelcar-prometheus-8x7b-v2-0/67922f21a4baf873b6f43d8c[rhelai1/modelcar-prometheus-8x7b-v2-0:1.4]), the {openshift-platform} cluster has a worker node with 1 or multiple GPUs capable of running this model (for example, a2-ultragpu-2g, which contains 2 x NVIDIA A100 with 80GB vRAM) and has at least at least 100 GiB of available disk storage to store the model.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Models* -> *Model catalog*.
+
The *Model catalog* page opens, which shows the pre-built, curated models that are available to your organization.
. Under *{org-name} models*, select a model with the `LAB teacher` or `LAB judge` label.
. On the model details page, click *Deploy model* to deploy a model server that hosts the selected model and makes it available to your project.
+
The *Deploy model* form appears.
. For *Project*, select your data science project.
. For *Model deployment name*, enter the name of the inference service to be created when the model is deployed.
. For *Serving runtime*, select *vLLM NVIDIA GPU ServingRuntime for KServe*.
//Select a *Serving runtime* with the `Compatible with hardware profile` label. For more information, see _Supported model-serving runtimes_.
+
The `vLLm` *Model framework* is automatically selected.
. For *Deployment mode*, select one of the following options:
* **Standard**: Recommended for catalog models. Uses default settings for a quick, guided deployment.
* **Advanced**: Use for custom models or when you need to change the model URI, runtime settings, or storage connection.
. Enter the *Number of model server replicas to deploy*. Set this number based on expected traffic and availability needs, such as support for failover.
. Select a *Hardware profile* with the `Compatible` label.
//Customize resource requests and limits
. For *Model route*, select the *Make deployed models available through an external route* checkbox.
. For *Token authentication*, select whether to *Require token authentication*. Enabling this option is recommended to reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities.
. For *Source model location*, select *Current URI*.
. Optional: Under *Configuration parameters*, add *Additional serving runtime arguments* or *Environment variables*, if needed. The values that you configure here apply only to this model deployment.
. Click *Deploy*.

.Verification

* The *Model deployments* page opens and shows your deployed model in the list. 
* The In Progress icon is displayed in the *Status* column. When the deployment completes successfully, the icon changes to a green checkmark.
