= Configuring the model registry component

[role='_abstract']
To configure the model registry feature for your data scientists to use in {productname-short}, you must install the following Operators in OpenShift, and then enable the `modelregistry` component in {productname-short}.

* Red Hat Authorino Operator
* Red Hat OpenShift Serverless Operator
* Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator
ifdef::upstream[]
* Open Data Hub Operator version 2
endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
* {productname-long} Operator
endif::[]

For more information about installing Operators in OpenShift, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/operators/administrator-tasks#olm-adding-operators-to-a-cluster[Adding Operators to a cluster].

.Prerequisites
* You have cluster administrator privileges for your {openshift-platform} cluster.
* You have access to the data science cluster.
* You have installed {productname-long}.
ifdef::cloud-service[]
* You have sufficient resources. In addition to the minimum {productname-short} resources described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/installing_and_uninstalling_{url-productname-short}/installing-and-deploying-openshift-ai_install[Installing and deploying {productname-short}], you need [x] to deploy the model registry component.
endif::[]
ifdef::self-managed[]
* You have sufficient resources. In addition to the minimum {productname-short} resources described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/installing_and_uninstalling_{url-productname-short}/installing-and-deploying-openshift-ai_install[Installing and deploying {productname-short}] (for disconnected environments, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/installing_and_uninstalling_{url-productname-short}_in_a_disconnected_environment/deploying-openshift-ai-in-a-disconnected-environment_install[Deploying {productname-short} in a disconnected environment]), you need  [x] to deploy the model registry component.

.Procedure
. In the {openshift-platform} console, click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
ifdef::self-managed,cloud-service[]
. Search for the *Red Hat OpenShift AI* Operator, and then click the Operator name to open the Operator details page.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
. Search for the *Open Data Hub Operator*, and then click the Operator name to open the Operator details page.
endif::[]
. Click the *Data Science Cluster* tab.
. Click the default instance name (for example, *default-dsc*) to open the instance details page.
. Click the *YAML* tab to show the instance specifications.
. In the `spec:components` section, set the `managementState` field for the `trustyai` component to `Managed`:

. Click *Save*.

.Verification
Check the status of the *model-registry-operator-controller-manager* pod:

ifdef::self-managed,cloud-service[]
. In the {openshift-platform} console, from the *Project* list, select *redhat-ods-applications*.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
. In the {openshift-platform} console, from the *Project* list, select *opendatahub*.
endif::[]
. Click *Workloads* -> *Deployments*.
. Search for the *model-registry-operator-controller-manager* deployment.
Check the status:
.. Click the deployment name to open the deployment details page.
.. Click the *Pods* tab.
.. View the pod status.
