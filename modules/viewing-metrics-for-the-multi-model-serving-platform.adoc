= Viewing model-serving runtime metrics for the multi-model serving platform

[role="_abstract"]
After a cluster administrator has configured monitoring for the multi-model serving platform, non-admin users can use the OpenShift web console to view model-serving runtime metrics for the ModelMesh component. 

.Prerequisites
ifdef::self-managed[]
* A cluster administrator has configured monitoring for the multi-model serving platform.
* You have been assigned the `monitoring-rules-view` role. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/monitoring/index#granting-users-permission-to-monitor-user-defined-projects_preparing-to-configure-the-monitoring-stack-uwm[Granting users permission to configure monitoring for user-defined projects^].
* You are familiar with how to monitor project metrics in the {openshift-platform} web console. For more information, see 
link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/building_applications/odc-monitoring-project-and-application-metrics-using-developer-perspective#odc-monitoring-your-project-metrics_monitoring-project-and-application-metrics-using-developer-perspective[Monitoring your project metrics^]. 
endif::[]
ifdef::cloud-service[]
* You have access to the OpenShift cluster as a developer or as a user with view permissions for the project that you are viewing metrics for.
* You are familiar with querying metrics in user-defined projects. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_dedicated/{osd-latest-version}/html-single/building_applications/index#odc-monitoring-project-and-application-metrics-using-developer-perspective[Monitoring project and application metrics using the Developer perspective in Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated^] or link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/{rosa-latest-version}/html/building_applications/odc-monitoring-project-and-application-metrics-using-developer-perspective[Monitoring project and application metrics using the Developer perspective in Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS^].
