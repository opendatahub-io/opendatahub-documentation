= Enabling the model registry component

[role='_abstract']

Before data scientists in your organization can work with the model registry feature, you must enable the `modelregistry` component in {productname-short}.

.Prerequisites
* You have cluster administrator privileges for your {openshift-platform} cluster.
* You have access to the data science cluster.
ifdef::cloud-service[]
* You have installed {productname-long} as an add-on to your {openshift-platform} cluster. 
* You have sufficient resources. For more information about the minimum resources required to use {productname-short}, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/installing_and_uninstalling_{url-productname-short}/installing-and-deploying-openshift-ai_install[Installing and deploying {productname-short}].
endif::[]
ifdef::self-managed[]
* You have installed the {productname-long} Operator on your {openshift-platform} cluster. 
* You have sufficient resources. For more information about the minimum resources required to use {productname-short}, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/installing_and_uninstalling_{url-productname-short}/installing-and-deploying-openshift-ai_install[Installing and deploying {productname-short}] (for disconnected environments, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/installing_and_uninstalling_{url-productname-short}_in_a_disconnected_environment/deploying-openshift-ai-in-a-disconnected-environment_install[Deploying {productname-short} in a disconnected environment]).
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* You have installed the {productname-long} Operator on your {openshift-platform} cluster. 
* You have sufficient resources. For more information about the minimum resources required to use {productname-short}, see link:{odhdocshome}/installing-open-data-hub/#installing-the-odh-operator-v2_installv2[Installing the {productname-short} Operator version 2].

.Procedure
. In the {openshift-platform} console, click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
ifdef::self-managed,cloud-service[]
. Search for the *{productname-long} Operator* version 2.14+, and then click the Operator name to open the Operator details page.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
. Search for the *Open Data Hub Operator*, and then click the Operator name to open the Operator details page.
endif::[]
. Click the *Data Science Cluster* tab.
. Click the default instance name (for example, *default-dsc*) to open the instance details page.
. Click the *YAML* tab to show the instance specifications.
ifdef::upstream[]
. Find the `spec.components` section, and then add or update it to include the following `modelregistry` component entry, with the `managementState` field set to `Managed`, and the `registriesNamespace` field set to `odh-model-registries`:
+
[source]
----
 modelregistry:
    managementState: Managed
    registriesNamespace: odh-model-registries
----
endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
. Find the `spec.components` section, and then add or update it to include the following `modelregistry` component entry, with the `managementState` field set to `Managed`, and the `registriesNamespace` field set to `rhoai-model-registries`:
+
[source]
----
 modelregistry:
    managementState: Managed
    registriesNamespace: rhoai-model-registries
----
endif::[]
. Click *Save*.

.Verification
* Confirm that the model registry namespace was created successfully:
.. In the OpenShift console, click *Home* â†’ *Projects*.
ifdef::upstream[]
.. Confirm that the `odh-model-registries` namespace appears in the *Projects* drop-down list.
endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
.. Confirm that the `rhoai-model-registries` namespace appears in the *Projects* drop-down list.
endif::[]

* Check the status of the *model-registry-operator-controller-manager* pod:
ifdef::self-managed,cloud-service[]
.. In the {openshift-platform} console, from the *Project* list, select *redhat-ods-applications*.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
.. In the {openshift-platform} console, from the *Project* list, select *opendatahub*.
endif::[]
.. Click *Workloads* -> *Deployments*.
.. Search for the *model-registry-operator-controller-manager* deployment.
.. Check the status:
... Click the deployment name to open the deployment details page.
... Click the *Pods* tab.
... View the pod status.
+
When the status of the *model-registry-operator-controller-manager-_<pod-id>_* pod is *Running*, the pod is ready to use.
