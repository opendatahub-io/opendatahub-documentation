[role='_abstract']
You can use Elyra to create visual end-to-end pipeline workflows in JupyterLab. Elyra is an extension for JupyterLab that provides you with a Pipeline Editor to create pipeline workflows that can execute in {productname-short}.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]

* You have created a data science project.
* You have created and configured a pipeline server within the data science project that contains your workbench.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To ensure that the runtime configuration is created automatically, you must create the pipeline server before you create the workbench.

* You have created a workbench with a workbench image that contains the Elyra extension (Standard Data Science, TensorFlow, TrustyAI, or PyTorch), as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/using-project-workbenches_projects#creating-a-workbench-select-ide_projects[Creating a workbench and selecting an IDE].
* You have started the workbench and opened the JupyterLab interface, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_in_your_data_science_ide/accessing-your-workbench-ide_ide[Accessing your workbench IDE].
endif::[]

endif::[]
* You have access to S3-compatible storage.

.Procedure
. After you open JupyterLab, confirm that the JupyterLab launcher is automatically displayed.
. In the *Elyra* section of the JupyterLab launcher, click the *Pipeline Editor* tile.
+
The Pipeline Editor opens.

.Verification
* You can view the Pipeline Editor in JupyterLab.
