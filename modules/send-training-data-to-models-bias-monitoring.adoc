= Sending training data to models

In this section, you'll pass all the training data through the models to be able to compute baseline fairness values.

. In a terminal window, run the following command from `2-BiasMonitoring`:
+
[source]
----
for batch in 0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 2250; do
  2-BiasMonitoring/scripts/send_data_batch
2-BiasMonitoring/data/training/$batch.json
done
----

This may take several minutes. The script prints out verification messages indicating whether TrustyAI is receiving the data, but you can also verify in the Cluster Metrics:

. In the OpenShift web console, select *Observe* -> *Metrics*.
. In the *Expression* field, enter `trustyai_model_observations_total` and hit *Run Queries*. You should see both models listed, each reporting around 2250 observed inferences:
. Optional step (time range isn't displayed until you run queries):
  * From the *Time range* list, select 5 minutes.
  * From the *Refresh interval* list, select 15 seconds.

This means that TrustyAI has cataloged 2250 inputs and outputs for each of the two models, which is adequate to begin analysis.
