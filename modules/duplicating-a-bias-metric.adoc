= Duplicating a bias metric

[role='_abstract']
If you want to edit an existing metric, you can duplicate (copy) it in the {productname-short} interface and then edit the values in the copy. However, note that the history of the original metric is not applied to the copy.

.Prerequisites
ifndef::upstream[]
* You are familiar with link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/monitoring_data_science_models/monitoring-model-bias_bias-monitoring#supported-bias-metrics_bias-monitoring[the bias metrics that {productname-short} supports] and how to interpret them.

* You are familiar with link:{odhdocshome}/monitoring-data-science-models/#supported-bias-metrics_bias-monitoring[the bias metrics that {productname-short} supports] and how to interpret them.
endif::[]

* You are familiar with the specific data set schema and understand the names and meanings of the inputs and outputs.

* There is an existing bias metric that you want to duplicate.

.Procedure
. In the left menu of the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Model Serving*.
. On the *Deployed models* page, click the name of the model with the bias metric that you want to duplicate.
. On the metrics page for the model, click the *Model bias* tab.
. Click *Configure*.
. On the *Bias metric configuration* page, click the action menu (&#8942;) next to the metric that you want to copy and then click *Duplicate*.
. In the *Configure bias metric* dialog, follow these steps:
.. In the *Metric name* field, type a unique name for your bias metric. Note that you cannot change the name of this metric later.

.. Change the values of the fields as needed. For a description of these fields, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/monitoring_data_science_models/monitoring-model-bias_bias-monitoring#creating-a-bias-metric-using-dashboard_bias-monitoring[Creating a bias metric by using the dashboard].

.. Change the values of the fields as needed. For a description of these fields, see link:{odhdocshome}/monitoring-data-science-models/#creating-a-bias-metric-using-dashboard_bias-monitoring[Creating a bias metric by using the dashboard].
endif::[]
.  Ensure that the values you entered are correct, and then click *Configure*.

.Verification
* The *Bias metric configuration* page shows the bias metrics that you configured for your model.

.Next step
To view metrics, on the *Bias metric configuration* page, click *View metrics* in the upper-right corner.
