= Notebook images for data scientists

[role='_abstract']
{productname-long} contains Jupyter notebook images optimized with industry-leading tools and libraries required for your data science work. To provide a consistent, stable platform for your model development, all notebook images contain the same version of Python. Notebook images available on {productname-long} are pre-built and ready for you to use immediately after {productname-short} is installed or upgraded. 

ifdef::upstream[]
When a new version of a notebook image is released, the previous version remains available on the cluster. This gives you time to migrate your work to the latest version of the notebook image. Legacy notebook image versions, that is, not the two most recent versions, might still be available for selection. Legacy image versions include a label that indicates that the image is out-of-date. To use the latest package versions, use the most recently added notebook image.
endif::[]

ifndef::upstream[]
Notebook images are supported for a minimum of one year. Major updates to pre-configured notebook images occur about every six months. Therefore, two supported notebook image versions are typically available at any given time. You can use this support period to update your code to use components from the latest available notebook image. Legacy notebook image versions, that is, not the two most recent versions, might still be available for selection. Legacy image versions include a label that indicates the image is out-of-date. To use the latest package versions, {org-name} recommends that you use the most recently added notebook image. If necessary, you can still access older notebook images from the registry, even if they are no longer supported. You can then add the older notebook images as custom notebook images to cater for your project's specific requirements.

.Default notebook images
[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Image name | Description

| CUDA
| If you are working with compute-intensive data science models that require GPU support, use the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) notebook image to gain access to the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit. Using this toolkit, you can optimize your work using GPU-accelerated libraries and optimization tools.

| Standard Data Science
| Use the Standard Data Science notebook image for models that do not require TensorFlow or PyTorch. This image contains commonly used libraries to assist you in developing your machine learning models.
// RHODS-1598 - or CUDA or GPU support

| TensorFlow
| TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. With TensorFlow, you can build, train and deploy your machine learning models. TensorFlow contains advanced data visualization features, such as computational graph visualizations. It also allows you to easily monitor and track the progress of your models.

| PyTorch
| PyTorch is an open source machine learning library optimized for deep learning. If you are working with computer vision or natural language processing models, use the Pytorch notebook image.
// RHODS-1598 -  using GPUs and CPUs

| Minimal Python
| If you do not require advanced machine learning features, or additional resources for compute-intensive data science work, you can use the Minimal Python image to develop your models.

| TrustyAI
| Use the TrustyAI notebook image to leverage your data science work with model explainability, tracing, and accountability, and runtime monitoring.

| HabanaAI
| The HabanaAI notebook image optimizes high-performance deep learning (DL) with Habana Gaudi devices. Habana Gaudi devices accelerate DL training workloads and maximize training throughput and efficiency.
