= Creating a bucket in your object store

[role='_abstract']
To create a bucket in your object store from your workbench, use the `create_bucket()` method.

.Prerequisites
* You have cloned the `odh-doc-examples` repository to your workbench.
* You have opened the `s3client_examples.ipynb` file in your workbench.
* You have installed Boto3 and configured an S3 client.

.Procedure
. In the notebook file, locate the following instructions to create a bucket:
+
[source]
----
#Create bucket                                                `	
s3_client.create_bucket(Bucket='<bucket_name>')
----
. Replace `<name_of_the_bucket>` with the name of the bucket that you want to create, as shown in the example, and then run the code cell.
+
[source]
----
#Create bucket
s3_client.create_bucket(Bucket='aqs43-image-registry')
----
+
The output displays an HTTP response status code of `200`, indicating a successful request.

* Locate the instructions to list buckets and execute the code cell.
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]

for bucket in s3_client.list_bucket()[‘Buckets’]:
    print(bucket[‘Name’])
