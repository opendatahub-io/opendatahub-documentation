. In the upper-right corner of your playground, click the action menu (⋮) and select *Delete playground*.

* Confirm that the playground is deleted from the project.
* In the *Gen AI studio* -> *AI asset endpoints* page, models no longer show the *Try in playground* button and instead show the *Add to playground* button.
