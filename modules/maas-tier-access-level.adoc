= Your tier and access level

[role="_abstract"]
Before you begin working with models, it's helpful to understand how MaaS determines your access level.

* *Tier assignment*: You are automatically assigned to a service tier based on your group membership in {openshift-platform}. If you belong to multiple groups, you are assigned to the tier with the highest level number.
* *Rate limits*: Your tier determines how many requests you can make per minute and how many tokens you can consume.
* *Model access*: Your tier determines which models you can access. You can only access models available to your assigned tier and cannot access models restricted to lower-priority tiers.
* *Authentication*: You must use a MaaS-issued token to access models.
