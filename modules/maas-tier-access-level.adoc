= Your tier and access level

[role="_abstract"]
Before you begin working with models, it's helpful to understand how MaaS determines your access level.

* *Tier assignment*: You are automatically assigned to a service tier based on your group membership in {openshift-platform}.
* *Rate limits*: Your tier determines how many requests you can make per minute and how many tokens you can consume.
* *Model access*: Some models may be available only to specific tiers.
* *Authentication*: You must use a MaaS-issued token to access models.
