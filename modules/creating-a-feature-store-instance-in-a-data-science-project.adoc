= Creating a feature store instance in a data science project

[role='_abstract']
You can add an instance of Feature Store to a data science project by creating a custom resource definition (CRD) in the OpenShift console.

The following example shows the minimum requirements for a Feature Store CRD YAML file:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: feast.dev/v1alpha1
kind: FeatureStore
metadata:
  name: sample
spec:
  feastProject: my_feast_project
----

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator privileges for your {openshift-platform} cluster.

* You have enabled the Feature Store component, as described in _Enabling the Feature Store component_.

* You have set up your database infrastructure for the online store, offline store, and registry. 
+
For an example of setting up and running PostgreSQL (for the registry) and Redis (for the online store), see the Feature Store Operator quick start example: https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/tree/stable/examples/operator-quickstart.


ifndef::upstream[]
* You have created a data science project, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/using-data-science-projects_projects#creating-a-data-science-project_projects[Creating a data science project]. In the following procedure, `my-ds-project` is the name of the data science project.
endif::[]

ifdef::upstream[]
* You have created a data science project, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working-on-data-science-projects/#creating-a-data-science-project_projects[Creating a data science project]. In the following procedure, `my-ds-project` is the name of the data science project.
endif::[]

.Procedure

. In the OpenShift console, click the *Quick Create* (image:images/quick-create-icon.png[]) icon and then click the *Import YAML* option.

. Verify that your data science project is the selected project.

. Copy the following code and paste it into the YAML editor:
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: feast.dev/v1alpha1
kind: FeatureStore
metadata:
  name: sample-git
spec:
  feastProject: credit_scoring_local
  feastProjectDir:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/feast-dev/feast-credit-score-local-tutorial
      ref: 598a270 
----
+
The `spec.feastProjectDir` references a Feature Store project that is in the Git repository for a Credit Store tutorial.

. Optionally, change the `metadata.name` for the feature store instance.
. Optionally, edit `feastProject`, which is the namespace for organizing your Feature Store instance. Note that this project is not the {productname-short} data science project.

. Click *Create*.

When you create the Feature Store CRD file in OpenShift, Feature Store starts a remote online feature server, and configures a default registry and an offline store with the local provider. 

A _provider_ is a customizable interface that provides default Feature Store components, such as the registry, offline store, and online store, that target a specific environment, ensuring that these components can work together seamlessly. The local provider uses the following default settings:

* *Registry:* A SQL registry or local file
* *Offline store:*  A Parquet file
* *Online store:* SQLite

.Verification

. In the {openshift-platform} console, select *Workloads* -> *Pods*.
. Make sure that your data science project (for example, my-ds-project) is selected.
. Find the pod that has the `feast-` prefix, followed by the `metadata.name` that you specified in the CRD configuration, for example, `sample-git`. 
. Verify that the pod status is *Running*.
. Click the `feast` pod and then select *Pod details*. 
. Scroll down to see the online container. This container is the deployment for the online server. It makes the feature server REST API available in the OpenShift cluster.
. Scroll up and then click *Terminal*.
. Run the following command to verify that the `feast` CLI is installed correctly:
+
----
$ feast --help
----

. To view the files for the feature store project, enter the following command:
+
----
$ ls -la
----
+
You should see output similar to the following:
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-output]
[source, yaml]
----
.
..
data
example_repo.py
feature_store.yaml
__init__.py
__pycache__
test_workflow.py
----

. To view the `feature_store.yaml` configuration file, enter the following command:
+
----
$ cat feature_store.yaml
----
+
You should see output similar to the following:
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-output]
[source, yaml]
----
project: my_feast_project
provider: local
online_store:
	path: /feast-data/online_store.db
	type: sqlite
registry:
	path: /feast-data/registry.db
	registry_type: file

	type: no_auth
entity_key_serialization_version: 3
----

The `feature_store.yaml` file defines the following components:

* *project* — The namespace for the Feature Store instance. Note that this project refers to the feature project rather than the {productname-short} data science project.

* *provider* — The environment in which Feature Store deploys and operates.

* *registry* — The location of the feature registry.

* *online_store* — The location of the online store.

* *auth* - The type of authentication and authorization (`no_auth`, `kubernetes`, or `oidc`) 

* *entity_key_serialization_version* - Specifies the serialization scheme that Feature Store uses when writing data to the online store. 

*NOTE:* Although the `offline_store` location is not included in the `feature_store.yaml` file, the feature store instance uses a DASK file-based offline store. In the `feature_store.yaml` file, the registry type is `file` but it uses a simple SQLite database.

.Next steps

* Optionally, you can customize the default configurations for the offline store, online store, or registry by editing the YAML configuration for the Feature Store CR, as described in _Customizing your feature store configuration_.

* Give your data scientists access to the data science project so that they can create a workbench. and provide them with a copy of the `feature_store.yaml` file so that they can add it to their workbench IDE, such as Jupyter.
