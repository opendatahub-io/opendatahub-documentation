= Deploying the Guardrails Orchestrator service

[role='_abstract']
You can deploy a Guardrails Orchestrator instance in your namespace to monitor elements, such as user inputs to your Large Language Model (LLM).


.Prerequisites
* You have cluster administrator privileges for your {openshift-platform} cluster.
* You have downloaded and installed the {openshift-platform} command-line interface (CLI). See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc[Installing the OpenShift CLI^].
* You are familiar with how to create a `configMap` for monitoring a user-defined workflow. You perform similar steps in this procedure. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html-single/nodes/index#nodes-pods-configmap-overview_configmaps[Understanding config maps].
* You have KServe set to `RawDeployment`. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_ai_self-managed/2-latest/html/serving_models/serving-large-models_serving-large-models#deploying-models-on-single-node-openshift-using-kserve-raw-deployment-mode_serving-large-models[Deploying models on single-node OpenShift using KServe Raw Deployment mode^].
* You have the TrustyAI component in your {productname-short} `DataScienceCluster` set to `Managed`.
* You have an LLM for chat generation deployed in your namespace.  
* You have an LLM for text classification deployed in your namespace. 


.Procedure
. Define a `ConfigMap` object in a YAML file to specify the `chat_generation` and `detectors` services. For example, create a file named `orchestrator_cm.yaml` with the following content:
+
.Example `orchestrator_cm.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: fms-orchestr8-config-nlp
data:
  config.yaml: |
    chat_generation: <1>
      service:
        hostname: <CHAT_GENERATION_HOSTNAME>
        port: 8080
    detectors:       <2>
      <DETECTOR_NAME>:
        type: text_contents
        service:
          hostname: <DETECTOR_HOSTNAME>
          port: 8000
        chunker_id: whole_doc_chunker
        default_threshold: 0.5
----
<1> A service for chat generation referring to a deployed LLM in your namespace where you are adding guardrails.
<2> A list of services responsible for running detection of a certain class of content on text spans. Each of these services refer to a deployed LLM for text classification in your namespace.

. Deploy the `orchestrator_cm.yaml` config map:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f orchestrator_cm.yaml -n <TEST_NAMESPACE>
----

. Specify the previously created `ConfigMap` object created in the `GuardrailsOrchestrator` custom resource (CR). For example, create a file named `orchestrator_cr.yaml` with the following content:
+
.Example `orchestrator_cr.yaml` CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: trustyai.opendatahub.io/v1alpha1
kind: GuardrailsOrchestrator
metadata:
  name: gorch-sample
spec:
  orchestratorConfig: "fms-orchestr8-config-nlp"
  replicas: 1
----

. Deploy the orchestrator CR, which creates a service account, deployment, service, and route object in your namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc apply -f orchestrator_cr.yaml -n <TEST_NAMESPACE>
----

.Verification
. Confirm that the orchestrator and LLM pods are running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n <TEST_NAMESPACE>
----
+
.Example response
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

ibm-hap-predictor-5d54c877d5-rbdms         1/1     Running   0          3h53m
llm-container-deployment-bd4d9d898-52r5j   1/1     Running   0          3h53m
llm-predictor-5d54c877d5-rbdms             1/1     Running   0          57m
----

. Query the `/health` endpoint of the orchestrator route to check the current status of the detector and generator services. If a `200 OK` response is returned, the services are functioning normally:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ GORCH_ROUTE_HEALTH=$(oc get routes gorch-test-health -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -v https://$GORCH_ROUTE_HEALTH/health
----
+
.Example response
[source,terminal]
