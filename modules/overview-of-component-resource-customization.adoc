= Overview of component resource customization

[role='_abstract']
You can customize deployment resources that are related to the {productname-long} Operator, for example, CPU and memory limits and requests. For resource customizations to persist without being overwritten by the Operator, the `opendatahub.io/managed: true` annotation must not be present in the YAML file for the component deployment. This annotation is absent by default.

Manually removing the `opendatahub.io/managed` annotation from any component deployment YAML file might cause `resource` entry values in the file to be erased.

Workaround::
To remove the annotation from a deployment, use the following steps to delete the deployment. The controller pod for the component will redeploy automatically with default values.

. Log in to the {openshift-platform} console as a cluster administrator.
. In the Administrator perspective, click Workloads > Deployments.
. From the Project drop-down list, select `redhat-ods-applications`.
. In the Name column, click the name of the deployment for the component for which you want to remove the annotation.
. Click the Options menu image:images/osd-ellipsis.png[Options menu].
. Click Delete Deployment.
