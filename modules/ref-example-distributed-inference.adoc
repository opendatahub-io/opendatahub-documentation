Technology Preview features are not supported with {org-name} production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete.
{org-name} does not recommend using them in production.
These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

== Single-node GPU deployment

Use single-GPU-per-replica deployment patterns for development, testing, or production deployments of smaller models, such as 7-billion-parameter models.

For examples using single-node GPU deployments, see link:https://github.com/red-hat-data-services/kserve/blob/main/docs/samples/llmisvc/single-node-gpu/README.md[Single-Node GPU Deployment Examples]. 

== Multi-node deployment

For examples using multi-node deployments, see link:https://github.com/red-hat-data-services/kserve/blob/main/docs/samples/llmisvc/dp-ep/deepseek-r1-gpu-rdma-roce/README.md[DeepSeek-R1 Multi-Node Deployment Examples].

== Intelligent inference scheduler with KV cache routing

You can configure the scheduler to track key-value (KV) cache blocks across inference endpoints and route requests to the endpoint with the highest cache hit rate. This configuration improves throughput and reduces latency by maximizing cache reuse.

For an example, see link:https://github.com/red-hat-data-services/kserve/blob/main/docs/samples/llmisvc/precise-prefix-kv-cache-routing/README.md[Precise Prefix KV Cache Routing].
