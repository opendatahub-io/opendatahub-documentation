= Disabling the local-queue labeling policy for all projects

[role='_abstract']
The local-queue labeling policy is enforced for all projects by default.
If the local-queue labeling policy is disabled, it is possible to create Ray clusters that do not use a local queue.
However, the resources of such Ray clusters are not managed by Kueue.

You can disable the local-queue labeling policy for all projects by editing the `ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding` resource as described in this procedure.

.Procedure

. In the {openshift-platform} console, open the *Administrator* perspective,
. From the *Project* list, select *All Projects*.
. Click *Home* -> *Search*.
. In the *Resources* list, search for *ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding*.
. Click the `kueue-validating-admission-policy-binding` entry to open the details page.
. Click the *YAML* tab to show the binding specifications.
. Edit the `policyName` field to change the value to `disabled`, as shown in the following example:

.Verification 

To verify that the local-queue labeling policy is disabled for Ray clusters:

. Create a project.
. Complete the following steps in the new project:
.. Before you configure a local queue, try to create a Ray cluster.
+
The Ray cluster is created, even though no local queue is configured, because the Validating Admission Policy is not enforced.
However, the Ray cluster resources are not managed by Kueue.
.. Create a local queue without the `default-queue` annotation.
.. Try to create a Ray cluster, and specify the local-queue name in the `local_queue` field.
+
The Ray cluster is created, and the Ray cluster resources are managed by Kueue.
.. Try to create a Ray cluster without specifying a value in the `local_queue` field.
+
The Ray cluster is created, but the Ray cluster resources are not managed by Kueue.
.. Edit the local queue to add the `kueue.x-k8s.io/default-queue: "true"` annotation, which configures that queue as the default local queue.
.. Try to create a Ray cluster without specifying a value in the `local_queue` field.
+
The Ray cluster is created, and the Ray cluster resources are managed by Kueue.

To verify that the local-queue labeling policy is disabled for PyTorchJobs:

. Create a project.
. Complete the following steps in the new project:
.. Before you configure a local queue, try to create a PyTorchJob.
+
The PyTorchJob is created, even though no local queue is configured, because the Validating Admission Policy is not enforced. The PyTorchJob resources are not managed by Kueue.
.. Create a local queue.
.. Try to create a PyTorchJob and add the `kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name: <local-queue-name>` label in the `labels` field.
+
The PyTorchJob is created, and the PyTorchJob resources are managed by Kueue.
.. Try to create a PyTorchJob without adding the `kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name: <local-queue-name>` label in the `labels` field.
+
The PyTorchJob is created, but the PyTorchJob resources are not managed by Kueue.
