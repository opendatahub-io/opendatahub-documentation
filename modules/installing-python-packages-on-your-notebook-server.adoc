[role='_abstract']
You can install Python packages that are not part of the default notebook server image by adding the package and the version to a `requirements.txt` file and then running the `pip install` command in a notebook cell.

NOTE: You can also install packages directly, but Red{nbsp}Hat recommends using a `requirements.txt` file so that the packages stated in the file can be easily re-used across different notebooks. In addition, using a `requirements.txt` file is also useful when using a S2I build to deploy a model.

Red{nbsp}Hat recommends specifying exact package versions to enhance the stability of your notebook server over time. New package versions can introduce undesirable or unexpected changes in your environment's behavior.

To install multiple packages at the same time, place each package on a separate line.
. Install the packages in `requirements.txt` to your server using a notebook cell.
.. Create a new cell in your notebook and enter the following command:
+
[source]
----
!pip install -r requirements.txt
----
.. Run the cell by pressing Shift and Enter.

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
This command installs the package on your notebook server, but you must still run the `import` directive in a code cell to use the package in your code.

----
import altair
----
====

.Verification
* Confirm that the packages in `requirements.txt` appear in the list of packages installed on the notebook server.
