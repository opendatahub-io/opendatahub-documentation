[role='_abstract']
You can install Python packages that are not part of the default notebook server image by adding the package and the version to a `requirements.txt` file and then running the `pip install` command in a notebook cell.

NOTE: You can also install packages directly, but {org-name} recommends using a `requirements.txt` file so that the packages stated in the file can be easily re-used across different notebooks. In addition, using a `requirements.txt` file is also useful when using a S2I build to deploy a model.

To install multiple packages at the same time, place each package on a separate line.
. Install the packages in `requirements.txt` to your server using a notebook cell.
.. Create a new cell in your notebook and enter the following command:
+
[source]
----
!pip install -r requirements.txt
----
.. Run the cell by pressing Shift and Enter.

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
This command installs the package on your notebook server, but you must still run the `import` directive in a code cell to use the package in your code.

----
import altair
----

.Verification
* Confirm that the packages in `requirements.txt` appear in the list of packages installed on the notebook server.
