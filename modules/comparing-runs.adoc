= Comparing runs

[role='_abstract']
You can compare up to 10 pipeline runs at one time, and view available parameter, scalar metric, confusion matrix, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve data for all selected runs.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group} ) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* You have previously created a data science project that is available and has a pipeline server.
* You have imported a pipeline to an active pipeline server.
* You have created at least 2 pipeline runs.

.Procedure
. In the {productname-short} dashboard, select *Experiments > Experiments and runs*.
+ 
The *Experiments* page opens.
. From the *Project* drop-down list, select the project that contains the runs that you want to compare.
. On the *Experiments tab*, in the *Experiment* column, click the experiment that you want to compare runs for. To select runs that are not in an experiment, click *Default*. All runs that are created without specifying an experiment will appear in the *Default* group.
+
The *Runs* page opens.
. Select the checkbox next to each run that you want to compare, and then click *Compare runs*. You can compare a maximum of 10 runs at one time.
+ 
The *Compare runs* page opens and displays available parameter, scalar metric, confusion matrix, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve data for the runs that you selected.
+
.. The *Run list* section displays a list of selected runs. You can filter the list by run name, experiment, pipeline version start date, duration, and status.
.. The *Parameters* section displays parameter information for each selected run. Set the *Hide parameters with no differences* switch to *On* to hide parameters that have the same values.
.. The *Metrics* section displays scalar metric, confusion matrix, and ROC curve data for all selected runs.
... On the *Scalar metrics* tab, set the *Hide parameters with no differences* switch to *On* to hide parameters that have the same values.
... On the *ROC curve* tab, in the artifacts list, adjust the ROC curve chart by deselecting the checkbox next to artifacts that you want to remove from the chart.
. To select different runs for comparison, click *Manage runs*.
+ 
The *Manage runs* dialog opens.
+
.. From the *Search* filter drop-down list, select *Run*, *Experiment*, *Pipeline version*, *Created after*, or *Status* to filter the run list by each value.
.. Clear the checkbox next to each run that you want to remove from your comparison.
.. Select the checkbox next to each run that you want to add to your comparison.
. Click *Update*.

.Verification
* The *Compare runs* page opens and displays data for the runs that you selected.
