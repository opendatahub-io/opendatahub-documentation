= Restoring the default PVC size for your cluster

[role='_abstract']
To change the size of resources utilized within your {productname-short} cluster, you can restore the default size of your cluster's persistent volume claim (PVC).

//Changing your cluster's default PVC size causes a redeployment of the Jupyter server launcher, making it temporarily unavailable. PVCs that were already assigned before the default size was changed are unaffected and retain their original size. Notebook servers created by users before the PVC size change are also unaffected.

//Users cannot access the Jupyter server launcher or create a new notebook server until redeployment is complete. {org-name} recommends that administrators consider the impact of these restrictions when determining the best time to change the default PVC size.
