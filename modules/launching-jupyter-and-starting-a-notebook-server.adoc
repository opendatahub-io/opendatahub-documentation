= Launching Jupyter and starting a notebook server

[role='_abstract']
Launch Jupyter and start a notebook server to start working with your notebooks.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
* You know the names and values you want to use for any environment variables in your notebook server environment, for example, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
* If you want to work with a very large data set, work with your administrator to proactively increase the storage capacity of your notebook server.

.Procedure

. Locate the *Jupyter* card on the *Enabled applications* page.

. Click *Launch application*.
+
If you see an *Access permission needed* message, you are not in the default user group or the default administrator group for {productname-short}.
ifndef::upstream[]
Contact your administrator so that they can add you to the correct group using link:{rhodsdocshome}{default-format-url}/managing_users#adding-users-for-openshift-data-science_useradd[Adding users for {productname-short}].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
Contact your administrator so that they can add you to the correct group.
endif::[]
+
If you have not previously authorized the `jupyter-nb-<username>` service account to access your account, the *Authorize Access* page appears prompting you to provide authorization. Inspect the permissions selected by default, and click the *Allow selected permissions* button.
+
If you credentials are accepted, the *Notebook server control panel* opens displaying the *Start a notebook server* page.
. Start a notebook server.
+
This is not required if you have previously opened Jupyter.

.. Select the *Notebook image* to use for your server.
.. If the notebook image contains multiple versions, select the version of the notebook image from the *Versions* section.
+
[NOTE]
--
When a new version of a notebook image is released, the previous version remains available and supported on the cluster. This gives you time to migrate your work to the latest version of the notebook image.
--
.. Select the *Container size* for your server.
.. Optional: Select the *Number of GPUs* (graphics processing units) for your server.
+
[IMPORTANT]
--
ifdef::upstream[]
Using GPUs to accelerate workloads is only supported with the PyTorch, TensorFlow, and CUDA notebook server images. In addition, you can specify the number of GPUs required for your notebook server only if GPUs are enabled on your cluster.

Using GPUs to accelerate workloads is only supported with the PyTorch, TensorFlow, and CUDA notebook server images. In addition, you can specify the number of GPUs required for your notebook server only if GPUs are enabled on your cluster. To learn how to enable GPU support, see link:{rhodsdocshome}{default-format-url}/managing_resources/enabling-gpu-support-in-openshift-data-science_user-mgmt[Enabling GPU support in {productname-short}].

--
.. Optional: Select and specify values for any new *Environment variables*.
+
The interface stores these variables so that you only need to enter them once. Example variable names for common environment variables are automatically provided for frequently integrated environments and frameworks, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that you select the *Secret* checkbox for any variables with sensitive values that must be kept private, such as passwords.
====
.. Optional: Select the *Start server in current tab* checkbox if necessary.
.. Click *Start server*.
+
The *Starting server* progress indicator appears. Click *Expand event log* to view additional information about the server creation process. Depending on the deployment size and resources you requested, starting the server can take up to several minutes. Click *Cancel* to cancel the server creation.
+
After the server starts, you see one of the following behaviors:
+
--
* If you previously selected the *Start server in current tab* checkbox, the JupyterLab interface opens in the current tab of your web browser.
* If you did not previously select the *Start server in current tab* checkbox, the *Starting server* dialog box prompts you to open the server in a new browser tab or in the current tab.
+
The JupyterLab interface opens according to your selection.
--

.Verification
* The JupyterLab interface opens.

.Troubleshooting
* If you see the "Unable to load notebook server configuration options" error message, contact your administrator so that they can review the logs associated with your Jupyter pod and determine further details about the problem.
