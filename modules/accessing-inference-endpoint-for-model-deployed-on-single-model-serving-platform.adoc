* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.

* You have deployed a model by using the single-model serving platform.
* If you enabled token authorization for your deployed model, you have the associated token value.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Model Serving*.
+
The inference endpoint for the model is shown in the *Inference endpoint* field.
. Depending on what action you want to perform with the model (and if the model supports that action), copy the inference endpoint and then add a path to the end of the URL.
. Use the endpoint to make API requests to your deployed model.
