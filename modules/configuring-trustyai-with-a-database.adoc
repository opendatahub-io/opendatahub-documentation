= Configuring TrustyAI with a database

[role='_abstract']

If you have a relational database in your {openshift-platform} cluster such as MySQL or MariaDB, you can configure TrustyAI to use your database instead of a persistent volume claim (PVC). Using a database instead of a PVC for storage can improve scalability, performance, and data management in TrustyAI. 
Provide TrustyAI with a database configuration secret before deployment. You can create a secret or specify the name of an existing Kubernetes secret within your project. 

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator privileges for your {openshift-platform} cluster.

* You have downloaded and installed the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI). See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI^].

ifndef::upstream[]
* You have enabled the TrustyAI component, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/monitoring_data_science_models/configuring-trustyai_monitor#enabling-trustyai-component_monitor[Enabling the TrustyAI component].

* The data scientist has created a data science project, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/using-data-science-projects_projects#creating-a-data-science-project_projects[Creating a data science project], that contains the models that the data scientist wants to monitor.  
endif::[]

ifdef::upstream[]
* You have enabled the TrustyAI component, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/monitoring-data-science-models/#enabling-trustyai-component_monitor[Enabling the TrustyAI component].

* The data scientist has created a data science project, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working-on-data-science-projects/#creating-a-data-science-project_projects[Creating a data science project], that contains the models that the data scientist wants to monitor.  
endif::[]

* If you are configuring the TrustyAI service with an external MySQL database, your database must already be in your cluster and use at least MySQL version 5.x. However, {org-name} recommends that you use MySQL version 8.x. 

* If you are configuring the TrustyAI service with a MariaDB database, your database must already be in your cluster and use MariaDB version 10.3 or later. However, {org-name} recommends that you use at least MariaDB version 10.5.

[NOTE]
--
The transport security layer (TLS) protocol does not work with the MariaDB operator 0.29 or later versions.

.Procedure

. In a terminal window, if you are not already logged in to your OpenShift cluster as a cluster administrator, log in to the OpenShift CLI as shown in the following example:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc login __<openshift_cluster_url>__ -u __<admin_username>__ -p __<password>__
----

. Optional: If you want to use a TLS connection between TrustyAI and the database, create a TrustyAI service database TLS secret that uses the same certificates that you want to use for the database.

.. Create a YAML file to contain your TLS secret and add the following code:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: __<service_name>__-db-tls
type: kubernetes.io/tls
data:
  tls.crt: |
    __<TLS CERTIFICATE>__ 
  
  tls.key: |
    __<TLS KEY>__ 
----

.. Save the file with the file name *_<service_name>_-db-tls.yaml*. For example, if your service name is `trustyai-service`, save the file as *trustyai-service-db-tls.yaml*.

.. Apply the YAML file in the data science project that contains the models that the data scientist wants to monitor:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc apply -f __<service_name>__-db-tls.yaml -n __<project_name>__
----

. Create a secret (or specify an existing one) that has your database credentials.

.. Create a YAML file to contain your secret and add the following code:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: db-credentials
type: Opaque
stringData:
  databaseKind: __<mariadb>__ <1>
  databaseUsername: __<TrustyAI_username>__ <2>
  databasePassword: __<TrustyAI_password>__ <3>
  databaseService: mariadb-service <4>
  databasePort: '3306' <5>
  databaseGeneration: update <6>
  databaseName: trustyai_service <7>
----
+
<1> The only currently supported `databaseKind` value is `mariadb`.
<2> The username you want TrustyAI to use when interfacing with the database.
<3> The password that TrustyAI must use when connecting to the database.
<4> The Kubernetes (K8s) service that TrustyAI must use when connecting to the database (the default `mariadb`) .
<5> The port that TrustyAI must use when connecting to the database (default is 3306).
<6>  The database schema generation strategy to be used by TrustyAI. It is the setting for the link:https://quarkus.io/guides/hibernate-orm#quarkus-hibernate-orm_quarkus-hibernate-orm-database-generation[`quarkus.hibernate-orm.database.generation`] argument, which determines how TrustyAI interacts with the database on its initial connection. Set to `none`, `create`, `drop-and-create`, `drop`, `update`, or `validate`. 
<7> The name of the individual database within the database service that the username and password authenticate to, as well as the specific database name that TrustyAI should read and write to on the database server.

.. Save the file with the file name *db-credentials.yaml*. You will need this name later when you install or change the TrustyAI service.

.. Apply the YAML file in the data science project that contains the models that the data scientist wants to monitor:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc apply -f db-credentials.yaml -n __<project_name>__
----
ifndef::upstream[]
. If you are installing TrustyAI for the first time on a project, continue to link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/monitoring_data_science_models/configuring-trustyai_monitor#installing-trustyai-service_monitor[Installing the TrustyAI service for a project].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
. If you are installing TrustyAI for the first time on a project, continue to link:{odhdocshome}/monitoring-data-science-models/#installing-trustyai-service_monitor[Installing the TrustyAI service for a project].
endif::[]
+
If you already installed TrustyAI on a project, you can migrate the existing TrustyAI service from using a PVC to using a database.

.. Create a YAML file to update the TrustyAI service custom resource (CR) and add the following code:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
apiVersion: trustyai.opendatahub.io/v1alpha1
kind: TrustyAIService
metadata:
  annotations:
    trustyai.opendatahub.io/db-migration: "true" <1>
  name: trustyai-service <2>
spec:
  storage:
    format: "DATABASE" <3>
    folder: "/inputs" <4>
      size: "1Gi" <5>
    databaseConfigurations: __<database_secret_credentials>__ <6>
  data:
    filename: "data.csv" <7>
  metrics:
    schedule: "5s" <8>
----
+
<1> Set to `true` to prompt the migration from PVC to database storage.
<2> The name of the TrustyAI service instance. 
<3> The storage format for the data. Set this field to `DATABASE`.
<4> The location within the PVC where you were storing the data. This must match the value specified in the existing CR.
<5> The size of the data to request.
<6> The name of the secret with your database credentials that you created in an earlier step. For example, `db-credentials`.
<7> The suffix for the existing stored data files. This must match the value specified in the existing CR.
<8> The interval at which to calculate the metrics. The default is `5s`. The duration is specified with the ISO-8601 format. For example, `5s` for 5 seconds, `5m` for 5 minutes, and `5h` for 5 hours.

.. Save the file. For example, *trustyai_crd.yaml*.

.. Apply the new TrustyAI service CR to the data science project that contains the models that the data scientist wants to monitor:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc apply -f trustyai_crd.yaml -n __<project_name>__
