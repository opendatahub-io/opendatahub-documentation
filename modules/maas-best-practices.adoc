Follow these recommendations to effectively use MaaS.

*Security*

* Never commit tokens to version control. Use environment variables or secret management systems.
* Regenerate tokens periodically. Generate new tokens regularly and discard old ones.
* Use named tokens for tracking. When generating tokens, note which application or purpose they are for.

*Performance*

* Implement retry logic with exponential backoff. Handle rate limit errors gracefully.
* Cache responses when appropriate. If you are making identical requests, consider caching results.
* Set reasonable `max_tokens` values. Do not request more tokens than you need, as token quotas are enforced.

*Cost management*

* Check rate limit headers. Review `X-RateLimit-Remaining` in API responses to track your usage against tier limits.
* Use the playground for testing. Test prompts in the playground before implementing them in code.
* Optimize prompts. Shorter, more focused prompts consume fewer tokens.
