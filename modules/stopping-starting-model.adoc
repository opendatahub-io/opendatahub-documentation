= Stopping and starting a deployed model

[role='_abstract']
You can stop a deployed model to perform edits without consuming cluster resources or triggering a redeployment. When you stop a model, all associated objects are terminated, and the model is unavailable for inference requests. When you start the model again, any pending configuration changes are applied.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
* You have deployed a model in a data science project.

.Procedure   

. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *AI hub* > *Deployments*.
. Locate the model that you want to stop or start.
. In the *Status* column for the model, click *Stop* or *Start*.
+
When you stop the model, the status changes to *Stopping* as the pods are terminated, and then changes to *Stopped*. When you start the model, the status changes to *Starting* as new pods are created, and then changes to *Running*.
