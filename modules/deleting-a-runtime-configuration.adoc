= Deleting a runtime configuration

[role='_abstract']
After you have finished using your runtime configuration, you can delete it from the JupyterLab interface. After deleting a runtime configuration, you cannot run pipelines in JupyterLab until you create another runtime configuration.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* You have created a data science project that contains a workbench.
* You have created and configured a pipeline server within the data science project that contains your workbench.
* A previously created runtime configuration is visible in the JupyterLab interface.
* You have created and launched a Jupyter server from a notebook image that contains the Elyra extension (Standard data science, TensorFlow, TrustyAI, PyTorch, or HabanaAI).

.Procedure
. In the left sidebar of JupyterLab, click *Runtimes* (image:images/jupyter-runtimes-sidebar.png[The Runtimes icon]).
. Hover the cursor over the runtime configuration that you want to delete and click the *Delete Item* button (image:images/jupyterlab-trash-button.png[Delete item]).
+
A dialog box appears prompting you to confirm the deletion of your runtime configuration.
. Click *OK*.
