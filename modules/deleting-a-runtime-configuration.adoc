= Deleting a runtime configuration

[role='_abstract']
After you have finished using your runtime configuration, you can delete it from the JupyterLab interface. After deleting a runtime configuration, you cannot run pipelines in JupyterLab until you create another runtime configuration.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
* You have created a project that contains a workbench.
* You have created and configured a pipeline server within the project that contains your workbench.
* A previously created runtime configuration is visible in the JupyterLab interface.
* You have created and launched a workbench from a workbench image that contains the Elyra extension (Standard Data Science, TensorFlow, TrustyAI, ROCm-PyTorch, ROCm-TensorFlow, or PyTorch).
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The Elyra pipeline editor is available in specific workbench images only. To use Elyra, the workbench must be based on a JupyterLab image. The Elyra extension is not available in code-server or RStudio IDEs. The workbench must also be derived from the Standard Data Science image. It is not available in Minimal Python or CUDA-based workbenches. All other supported JupyterLab-based workbench images have access to the Elyra extension.

.Procedure
. In the left sidebar of JupyterLab, click *Runtimes* (image:images/jupyter-runtimes-sidebar.png[The Runtimes icon]).
. Hover the cursor over the runtime configuration that you want to delete and click the *Delete Item* button (image:images/jupyterlab-trash-button.png[Delete item]).
+
A dialog box opens prompting you to confirm the deletion of your runtime configuration.
. Click *OK*.

.Verification
* The runtime configuration that you deleted is no longer shown on the *Runtimes* tab (image:images/jupyter-runtimes-sidebar.png[The Runtimes icon]) in the left sidebar of JupyterLab.
