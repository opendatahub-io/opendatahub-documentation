.Procedure

[IMPORTANT]
====
These steps are only supported in {productname-short} versions 2.19 and later.
====

. In the {productname-short} dashboard, navigate to the project details page and click the *Deployments* tab.
. In the *Model serving platform* tile, click *Select model*.
. Click the *Deploy model* button.
+
The *Deploy model* dialog opens.
. Configure the deployment properties for your model:
.. In the *Model deployment name* field, enter a unique name for your deployment.
.. In the *Serving runtime* field, select `vLLM NVIDIA GPU serving runtime for KServe` from the drop-down list.
.. In the *Deployment mode* field, select *KServe RawDeployment* from the drop-down list.
.. Set *Number of model server replicas to deploy* to `1`.
.. In the *Model server size* field, select `Custom` from the drop-down list.
+
--
* Set *CPUs requested* to `1 core`.
* Set *Memory requested* to `10 GiB`.
* Set *CPU limit* to `2 core`.
* Set *Memory limit* to `14 GiB`.
* Set *Accelerator* to `NVIDIA GPUs`.
* Set *Accelerator count* to `1`.
--
.. From the *Connection type*, select a relevant data connection from the drop-down list.
. In the *Additional serving runtime arguments* field, specify the following recommended arguments:
+
[source,shell]
----
--dtype=half
--max-model-len=20000
--gpu-memory-utilization=0.95
--enable-chunked-prefill
--enable-auto-tool-choice
--tool-call-parser=llama3_json
--chat-template=/app/data/template/tool_chat_template_llama3.2_json.jinja
----
.. Click *Deploy*.
+
[NOTE]
====
Model deployment can take several minutes, especially for the first model that is deployed on the cluster. Initial deployment may take more than 10 minutes while the relevant images download.
====

.Verification 
. Verify that the `kserve-controller-manager` and `odh-model-controller` pods are running:
.. Open a new terminal window.
.. Log in to your {openshift-platform} cluster from the CLI:
.. In the upper-right corner of the OpenShift web console, click your user name and select *Copy login command*.
.. After you have logged in, click *Display token*.
.. Copy the *Log in with this token* command and paste it in the {openshift-cli}.
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc login --token=__<token>__ --server=__<openshift_cluster_url>__
----
.. Enter the following command to verify that the `kserve-controller-manager` and `odh-model-controller` pods are running:
ifdef::upstream[]
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n opendatahub | grep -E 'kserve-controller-manager|odh-model-controller'
----
endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
+
[source,terminal, subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get pods -n {dbd-config-default-namespace} | grep -E 'kserve-controller-manager|odh-model-controller'
----
endif::[]
+
.. Confirm that you see output similar to the following example:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
kserve-controller-manager-7c865c9c9f-xyz12   1/1     Running   0          4m21s
odh-model-controller-7b7d5fd9cc-wxy34        1/1     Running   0          3m55s
----
+
.. If you do not see either of the `kserve-controller-manager` and `odh-model-controller` pods, there could be a problem with your deployment. In addition, if the pods appear in the list, but their `Status` is not set to `Running`, check the pod logs for errors:
ifndef::upstream[]
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs <pod-name> -n redhat-ods-applications
----
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs <pod-name> -n opendatahub
----
endif::[]
+
.. Check the status of the inference service:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get inferenceservice -n llamastack
$ oc get pods -n <project name> | grep llama
----
* The deployment automatically creates the following resources:
** A `ServingRuntime` resource.
** An `InferenceService` resource, a `Deployment`, a pod, and a service pointing to the pod.
* Verify that the server is running. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs llama-32-3b-instruct-predictor-77f6574f76-8nl4r  -n <project name>
----
+
Check for output similar to the following example log:
+
[source,log]
----
INFO     2025-05-15 11:23:52,750 __main__:498 server: Listening on ['::', '0.0.0.0']:8321
INFO:     Started server process [1]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO     2025-05-15 11:23:52,765 __main__:151 server: Starting up
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://['::', '0.0.0.0']:8321 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
----
* The deployed model displays in the *Deployments* tab on the project details page for the project it was deployed under.
. If you see a `ConvertTritonGPUToLLVM` error in the pod logs when querying the `/v1/chat/completions` API, and the vLLM server restarts or returns a `500 Internal Server` error, apply the following workaround:
+
Before deploying the model, remove the `--enable-chunked-prefill` argument from the *Additional serving runtime arguments* field in the deployment dialog.
+
The error is displayed similar to the following:
+
[source,log]
----
/opt/vllm/lib64/python3.12/site-packages/vllm/attention/ops/prefix_prefill.py:36:0: error: Failures have been detected while processing an MLIR pass pipeline
