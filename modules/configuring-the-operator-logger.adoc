= Configuring the {productname-short} Operator logger

[role='_abstract']
You can change the log level for {productname-short} Operator components by setting the `.spec.devFlags.logmode` flag for the *DSC Initialization*/`DSCI` custom resource during runtime. If you do not set a `logmode` value, the logger uses the INFO log level by default.

The log level that you set with `.spec.devFlags.logmode` applies to all components, not just those in a *Managed* state.

The following table shows the available log levels:

|===
| Log level | Stacktrace level | Verbosity | Output | Timestamp type 

| `devel` or `development` | WARN | INFO | Console | Epoch timestamps 
| `""`  (or no `logmode` value set) | ERROR | INFO | JSON | Human-readable timestamps 
| `prod` or `production` | ERROR | INFO | JSON | Human-readable timestamps 
|===

Logs that are set to `devel` or `development` generate in a plain text console format.
Logs that are set to `prod`, `production`, or which do not have a level set generate in a JSON format.

.Prerequisites
* You have administrator access to the `DSCInitialization` resources in the {openshift-platform} cluster.
* You have installed the {openshift-cli} as described in the appropriate documentation for your cluster:

.Procedure
. Log in to the {openshift-platform} as a cluster administrator.
. Click *Operators* â†’ *Installed Operators* and then click the {productname-long} Operator.
. Click the *DSC Initialization* tab.
. Click the *default-dsci* object.
. Click the *YAML* tab.
. In the `spec` section, update the `.spec.devFlags.logmode` flag with the log level that you want to set.

[source]
----
apiVersion: dscinitialization.opendatahub.io/v1
kind: DSCInitialization
metadata:
  name: default-dsci
spec:
  devFlags:
    logmode: development
----
. Click *Save*.

You can also configure the log level from the {openshift-cli} by using the following command with the `logmode` value set to the log level that you want.

[source]
----
oc patch dsci default-dsci -p '{"spec":{"devFlags":{"logmode":"development"}}}' --type=merge
----

.Verification

* If you set the component log level to `devel` or `development`, logs generate more frequently and include logs at `WARN` level and above.
* If you set the component log level to `prod` or `production`, or do not set a log level, logs generate less frequently and include logs at `ERROR` level or above.

== Viewing the {productname-short} Operator logs

ifdef::upstream[]
. Log in to the {openshift-cli}.
. Run the following command to stream logs from all Operator pods:
+
[source]
----
for pod in $(oc get pods -l name=opendatahub-operator -n openshift-operators -o name); do
  oc logs -f "$pod" -n openshift-operators &
done
----
+
The Operator pod logs open in your terminal.
+
TIP: Press `Ctrl+C` to stop viewing. To fully stop all log streams, run `kill $(jobs -p)`.
endif::[]

ifndef::upstream[]
. Log in to the {openshift-cli}.
. Run the following command to stream logs from all Operator pods:
+
[source, subs="attributes+"]
----
for pod in $(oc get pods -l name=rhods-operator -n {operator-default-namespace} -o name); do
  oc logs -f "$pod" -n {operator-default-namespace} &
done
----
+
The Operator pod logs open in your terminal.
+
TIP: Press `Ctrl+C` to stop viewing. To fully stop all log streams, run `kill $(jobs -p)`.

You can also view each Operator pod log in the {openshift-platform} console by navigating to *Workloads* -> *Pods*, selecting the *`pass:attributes[{operator-default-namespace}]`* project, clicking a pod name, and then clicking the *Logs* tab.
