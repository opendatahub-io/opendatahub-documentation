= Selecting {productname-short} administrator and user groups

By default, all users authenticated in OpenShift can access {productname-short}.

Also by default, users with `cluster-admin` permissions are {productname-short} administrators. A `cluster admin` is a superuser that can perform any action in any project in the OpenShift cluster. When bound to a user with a local binding, they have full control over quota and every action on every resource in the project. 

After a `cluster admin` user defines additional administrator and user groups in OpenShift, you can add those groups to {productname-short} by selecting them in the {productname-short} dashboard.

.Prerequisites

* You have logged in to {productname-short} as a user with {productname-short} administrator privileges.

ifdef::upstream[]
* The groups that you want to select as administrator and user groups for {productname-short} already exist in {openshift-platform}. For more information, see
link:{odhdocshome}/managing-odh/#managing-users-and-groups[Managing users and groups].

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Settings* -> *User management*.
