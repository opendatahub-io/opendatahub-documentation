= Adding users to {productname-short} user groups

By default, all OpenShift users have access to {productname-long}. 

Optionally, you can restrict user access to your {productname-short} instance by defining user groups. You must grant users permission to access {productname-long} by adding user accounts to the {productname-long} user group, administrator group, or both. You can either use the default group name, or specify a group name that already exists in your identity provider.

The *user group* provides the user with access to product components in the {productname-long} dashboard, such as data science pipelines, and associated services, such as Jupyter. By default, users in the *user group* have access to data science pipeline applications within data science projects that they created. 

The *administrator group* provides the user with access to developer and administrator functions in the {productname-long} dashboard, such as data science pipelines, and associated services, such as Jupyter. Users in the *administrator group* can configure data science pipeline applications in the {productname-short} dashboard for any data science project.

If you restrict access by using user groups, users that are not in the {productname-short} user group or administrator group cannot view the dashboard and use associated services, such as Jupyter. They are also unable to access the *Cluster settings* page.

If you are using LDAP as your identity provider, you need to configure LDAP syncing to OpenShift.
