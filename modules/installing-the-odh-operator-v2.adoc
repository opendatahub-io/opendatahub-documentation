= Installing the Open Data Hub Operator version 2

.Prerequisites
* You are using OpenShift Container Platform {ocp-minimum-version} or later.
* Your OpenShift cluster has a minimum of 16 CPUs and 32GB of memory across all OpenShift worker nodes.
* You have cluster administrator privileges for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* If you are installing {productname-short} 2.10.0 or later with data science pipelines, ensure your cluster does not have a separate installation of Argo Workflows that was not installed by {productname-short}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Data science pipelines 2.0 includes an installation of Argo Workflows. {productname-short} does not support direct customer usage of this installation of Argo Workflows.

If there is an existing installation of Argo Workflows that is not installed by data science pipelines on your cluster, data science pipelines will be disabled after you install {productname-short}.

To enable data science pipelines, remove the separate installation of Argo Workflows from your cluster. Data science pipelines will be enabled automatically. 

Argo Workflows resources that are created by {productname-short} have the following labels in the OpenShift Console under *Administration > CustomResourceDefinitions*, in the `argoproj.io` group:

    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: data-science-pipelines-operator
    app.opendatahub.io/data-science-pipelines-operator: 'true'
