= About the single-model serving platform

[role="_abstract"]
The single-model serving platform consists of the following components:

* link:https://github.com/opendatahub-io/kserve[KServe^]: A Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD) that orchestrates model serving for all types of models. It includes model-serving runtimes that implement the loading of given types of model servers. KServe handles the lifecycle of the deployment object, storage access, and networking setup.

* link:https://docs.openshift.com/serverless/{os-latest-version}/about/about-serverless.html[{org-name} OpenShift Serverless^]: A cloud-native development model that allows for serverless deployments of models. OpenShift Serverless is based on the open source link:https://knative.dev/docs/[Knative^] project.

* link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp-latest-version}/service_mesh/v2x/ossm-architecture.html[{org-name} OpenShift Service Mesh^]: A service mesh networking layer that manages traffic flows and enforces access policies. OpenShift Service Mesh is based on the open source link:https://istio.io/[Istio^] project.

* link:https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/service_mesh/v2x/ossm-architecture.html[{org-name} OpenShift Service Mesh^]: Service mesh networking layer that manages traffic flows and enforces access policies. OpenShift Service Mesh is based on the open source link:https://istio.io/[Istio^] project.

To install the single-model serving platform, you have the following options:

Automated installation:: If you have not already created a `ServiceMeshControlPlane` or `KNativeServing` resource on your OpenShift cluster, you can configure the {productname-long} Operator to install KServe and configure its dependencies.

Manual installation:: If you have already created a `ServiceMeshControlPlane` or `KNativeServing` resource on your OpenShift cluster, you _cannot_ configure the {productname-long} Operator to install KServe and configure its dependencies. In this situation, you must install KServe manually.

When you have installed KServe, you can use the {productname-short} dashboard to deploy models using preinstalled or custom model-serving runtimes. 

ifdef::upstream[]
{productname-short} includes preinstalled runtimes for KServe. For more information, see link:{odhdocshome}/serving-models/#ref-supported-runtimes_serving-large-models[Supported model-serving runtimes].

{productname-short} includes preinstalled runtimes for KServe. For more information, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/serving-models/serving-large-models_serving-large-models#ref-supported-runtimes[Supported model-serving runtimes].

You can also configure monitoring for the single-model serving platform and use Prometheus to scrape the available metrics.
