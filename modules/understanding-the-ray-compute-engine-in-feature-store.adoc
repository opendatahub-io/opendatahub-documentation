== Understanding the Ray compute engine in Feature Store 

[role="_abstract"]
The Ray compute engine is a distributed compute implementation that uses Ray for executing feature pipelines. This includes transformations, aggregations, joins, and materializations. It provides scalable and efficient distributed processing for both `materialize()` and `get_historical_features() operations.`

.The Ray RAG template features:
* **Parallel embedding generation:** Uses the Ray compute engine to generate embeddings across multiple workers.
* **Vector search integration:** Works with Milvus for semantic similarity search.
* **Complete RAG pipeline:** The Ray compute engine automatically distributes the embedding generation across available workers, making it ideal for processing large datasets efficiently.

.Ray compute engine features:
* **Distributed directed acyclic graphs (DAG) Execution:** Executes feature computation DAGs across Ray clusters
* **Intelligent Join Strategies:** Automatic selection between broadcast and distributed joins
* **Lazy Evaluation:** Deferred execution for optimal performance
* **Resource Management:** Automatic scaling and resource optimization
* **Point-in-Time Joins:** Efficient temporal joins for historical feature retrieval
