= Creating a data drift metric

[role='_abstract']
To monitor a deployed model for data drift, you must first create drift metrics. 

For the complete list of TrustyAI metrics, see link:https://trustyai-explainability.github.io/trustyai-site/main/trustyai-service-api-reference.html[TrustyAI service API].

//You can create a data drift metric for a model by using the {productname-short} dashboard or by using the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI).
