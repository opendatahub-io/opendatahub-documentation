= Defining a pipeline

[role='_abstract']
The Kubeflow Pipelines SDK enables you to define end-to-end machine learning and data pipelines. Use the latest Kubeflow Pipelines 2.0 SDK to build your data science pipeline in Python code. After you have built your pipeline, use the SDK to compile it into an Intermediate Representation (IR) YAML file. After defining the pipeline, you can import the YAML file to the {productname-short} dashboard to enable you to configure its execution settings.

You can also use the Elyra JupyterLab extension to create and run data science pipelines within JupyterLab. For more information about the Elyra JupyterLab extension, see link:https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html[Elyra Documentation].
