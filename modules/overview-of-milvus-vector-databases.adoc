= Overview of Milvus vector databases

[role="_abstract"]
Milvus is an open source vector database designed for high-performance similarity search across large volumes of embedding data. In {productname-short}, Milvus is supported as a vector store provider for Llama Stack and enables retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workloads that require efficient vector indexing, scalable search, and durable storage.

Starting with {productname-short} 3.2, production-grade Llama Stack deployments default to PostgreSQL for metadata persistence. When Milvus is used as the vector store, PostgreSQL is typically used for Llama Stack metadata, while Milvus manages vector indexes and similarity search.

Milvus vector databases provide the following capabilities in {productname-short}:

* High-performance similarity search using Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms
* Efficient indexing and query optimization for dense embeddings
* Persistent storage of vector data
* Integration with Llama Stack through an OpenAI-compatible Vector Stores API

In a typical RAG workflow in {productname-short}, the following responsibilities are separated:

* *Embedding generation*  
  Embeddings are generated by the configured embedding provider. In {productname-short} 3.2, remote embedding models are the recommended and default option for production deployments.

* *Vector storage and retrieval*  
  Milvus stores embedding vectors and performs similarity search operations.

* *Metadata persistence*  
  Llama Stack stores vector store metadata, file references, and configuration state using PostgreSQL in production deployments.

* *Llama Stack server*  
  Coordinates ingestion, retrieval, and model inference through a unified API surface.

In {productname-short}, Milvus can be used in the following operational modes:

* *Inline Milvus Lite*  
  Runs embedded within the Llama Stack Distribution pod. Inline Milvus Lite is intended for experimentation, development, or small datasets. It does not provide high availability or horizontal scalability and is not recommended for production use.

* *Remote Milvus*  
  Runs as a standalone service within your {openshift-platform} project or as an external managed Milvus deployment. Remote Milvus is recommended for production-grade RAG workloads.

A remote Milvus deployment typically includes the following components:

* A *Milvus service* that exposes a gRPC endpoint (port 19530) for client traffic
* An *etcd service* that Milvus uses for metadata coordination, collection state, and index management
* *Persistent storage* for durable vector data

Milvus requires a dedicated etcd instance for metadata coordination, even when running in standalone mode. Do not use the OpenShift control plane etcd for this purpose. For more information about etcd, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/etcd/index[Providing redundancy with etcd^].

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must deploy a dedicated etcd service for Milvus or connect Milvus to an external etcd instance. Do not share the OpenShift control plane etcd with application workloads.
====

Use *Remote Milvus* when you require scalable vector search, high-performance retrieval, and integration with production-grade Llama Stack deployments in {productname-short}.
