= Viewing performance metrics for all models on a model server

[role='_abstract']

You can monitor the following metrics for all the models that are deployed on a model server:

* *HTTP requests per 5 minutes* - The number of HTTP requests that have failed or succeeded for all models on the server.
* *Average response time (ms)* - For all models on the server, the average time it takes the model server to respond to requests.
* *CPU utilization (%)* - The percentage of the CPU's capacity that is currently being used by all models on the server.
* *Memory utilization (%)* - The percentage of the system's memory that is currently being used by all models on the server.

You can specify a time range and a refresh interval for these metrics to help you determine, for example, when the peak usage hours are and how the models are performing at a specified time.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed {productname-long}.

* On the OpenShift cluster where {productname-short} is installed, user workload monitoring is enabled.

* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* You have deployed models on the multi-model serving platform.

.Procedure

. From the {productname-short} dashboard navigation menu, click *Data Science Projects*.
+
The *Data Science Projects* page opens.
. Click the name of the project that contains the data science models that you want to monitor.

. In the project details page, click the *Models* tab.

. In the row for the model server that you are interested in, click the action menu (&#8942;) and then select *View model server metrics*.

. Optional: On the metrics page for the model server, set the following options:

** *Time range* - Specifies how long to track the metrics. You can select one of these values: 1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days.

** *Refresh interval* - Specifies how frequently the graphs on the metrics page are refreshed (to show the latest data). You can select one of these values: 15 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 1 day.

. Scroll down to view data graphs for HTTP requests per 5 minutes, average response time, CPU utilization, and memory utilization.

.Verification

On the metrics page for the model server, the graphs provide data on performance metrics.
