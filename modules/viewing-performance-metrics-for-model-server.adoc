= Viewing performance metrics for all models on a model server

[role='_abstract']

You can monitor the following metrics in {productname-short} for all the models that are deployed on a model server:

* HTTP requests that have failed or succeeded
* Average response time (ms)
* CPU utilization (%)
* Memory utilization (%) 

You can specify a time range and a refresh interval for these metrics to help you determine, for example, when the peak usage hours are and how the models are performing at a specified time.


.Prerequisites
* You have installed {productname-long}.

* On the OpenShift cluster where {productname-short} is installed, you have enabled user workload monitoring as described in link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp-latest-version}/monitoring/enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects.html[Enabling monitoring for user-defined projects].

* You have logged in to {productname-short}.

* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* There are deployed data science models in your data science project.

.Procedure 

. From the {productname-short} dashboard navigation menu, click *Data Science Projects* and then select the project that contains the data science models that you want to monitor.

. On the *Components* page, scroll down to the *Models and model servers* section.

. In the row for the model server that you are interested in, click the action menu (&#8942;) and then select *View model server metrics*.

. On the metrics page for the model server, optionally set the following options:

** *Time range* - Specifies how long to track the metrics. You can select one of these values: 1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days.

** *Refresh interval* - Specifies how frequently the graphs on the metrics page are refreshed (to show the latest data). You can select one of these values: 15 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 1 day.

. Scroll down to view data graphs for HTTP requests, Average response time, CPU utilization, and memory utilization.

.Verification

On the metrics page for the model server, the graphs provide performance metric data.
