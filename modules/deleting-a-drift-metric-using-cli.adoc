= Deleting a drift metric by using the CLI

[role='_abstract']
You can use the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI) to delete a drift metric for a model.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

ifndef::upstream[]
* You have a user token for authentication as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/monitoring_data_science_models/setting-up-trustyai-for-your-project_monitor#authenticating-trustyai-service_monitor[Authenticating the TrustyAI service].
endif::[]

ifdef::upstream[]
* You have a user token for authentication as described in link:{odhdocshome}/monitoring-data-science-models/#authenticating-trustyai-service_monitor[Authenticating the TrustyAI service].
endif::[]

* There is an existing drift metric that you want to delete.

.Procedure

. Open a new terminal window.
. Follow these steps to log in to your {openshift-platform} cluster:
.. In the {openshift-platform} web console, click your user name and select *Copy login command*. 
.. After you have logged in, click *Display token*.
.. Copy the *Log in with this token* command and paste it in the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI).

----
$ oc login --token=__<token>__ --server=__<openshift_cluster_url>__
----

. In the OpenShift CLI, get the route to the TrustyAI service: 
+
[source]
----
TRUSTY_ROUTE=https://$(oc get route/trustyai-service --template={{.spec.host}})
----

. Optional: To list all currently active requests for a metric, use `GET /metrics/{{metric}}/requests`. For example, to list all currently scheduled MeanShift metrics, type:
+
----
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X GET --location "$TRUSTY_ROUTE/metrics/drift/meanshift/requests"
----
+
Alternatively, to list all currently scheduled metric requests, use `GET /metrics/all/requests`. 
+
----
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X GET --location "$TRUSTY_ROUTE/metrics/all/requests"
----

. To delete a metric, send an HTTP `DELETE` request to the `/metrics/$METRIC/request` endpoint to stop the periodic calculation, including the id of periodic task that you want to cancel in the payload. For example:
+
----
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X DELETE --location "$TRUSTY_ROUTE/metrics/drift/meanshift/request" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{
          \"requestId\": \"$id\"
        }"
----

.Verification
Use `GET /metrics/{{metric}}/requests` to list all currently active requests for the metric and verify the metric that you deleted is not shown. For example:

----
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X GET --location "$TRUSTY_ROUTE/metrics/drift/meanshift/requests"
----
