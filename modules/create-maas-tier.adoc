= Create a tier

[role="_abstract"]
Create a new tier through the {productname-short} dashboard to define service levels, resource limits, and group assignments.

.Prerequisites

* You have logged in to {productname-short}.
* You have administrator access to the {productname-short} dashboard.

.Procedure

. In the left navigation menu, click *Settings*.
. Click *Tiers* to view existing tiers.
. Click *Create tier*.
. In the *Create tier* form, configure the tier:
.. *Name*: Enter a descriptive name for the tier that will be displayed to users, such as `Production Tier` or `Data Science Team`.
.. Optional: Click *Edit resource name* to set a custom internal identifier for the tier. If not specified, the resource name is generated automatically from the display name. The resource name must use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only.
.. Optional: *Description*: Provide a brief description of the tier's purpose and intended users.
.. *Level*: Set the tier priority level using a numeric value. Higher numbers indicate higher priority. When a user belongs to multiple groups, they are assigned the tier with the highest level value. For example, use 0 for the lowest tier, 1 for medium, and 2 for the highest.
.. *Groups*: Select or create the OpenShift groups that should be assigned to this tier. Users who are members of these groups will be automatically assigned to this tier.
. Configure rate limits:
.. To limit token consumption, select *Enforce token rate limit* and click *Add token rate limit*. Enter the number of tokens allowed, enter the time period, and select the time unit. For example, set `100000` tokens per `1` `minute` for production workloads.
.. To limit API requests, select *Enforce request rate limit* and click *Add request rate limit*. Enter the number of requests allowed, enter the time period, and select the time unit. For example, set `1000` requests per `1` `minute` for production workloads.
