=  Feature Store workflow

The Feature Store workflow involves the following tasks for ML engineers, OpenShift cluster administrators, and data scientists:	

*Note:* This Feature Store workflow describes a local implementation. A production client-server architecture with full authorization and role assignments is planned for a future release.

*Cluster administrator*

. Installs OpenShift AI.
. Enables the Feature Store component by using the Feature Store operator.
. Creates a data science project.
. In the data science project, creates a Feature Store instance by using a `feast.yaml` file that specifies the offline and online stores.
. Sets up Feature Store so that ML Engineers and data scientists can push and retrieve features to use for model training and inference.

For more information, see _Chapter 2. Configuring Feature Store_.

*ML Engineer*

* Creates a feature definition file.
* Defines the data sources and other feature store objects.
* Makes features available for real-time inference.

For more information, see _Chapter 3: Defining features_.

*Data scientist*

. Creates a workbench.
. Obtains the `feature_store.yaml` from the cluster administrator.
. Installs the Feature Store Python SDK in their IDE environment, for example Jupyter.
. Uses `feast` Python APIs to retrieve features for model training in the workbench.

For more information, see _Chapter 4. Retrieving features for model training_.
