= Creating a bias metric

[role='_abstract']
To monitor a deployed model for bias, you must first create bias metrics. When you create a bias metric, you specify details relevant to your model such as a protected attribute, privileged and unprivileged groups, a model outcome and a value that you want to monitor, and the acceptable threshold for bias.

You can create a bias metric for a model by using the {productname-short} dashboard or by using the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI).
