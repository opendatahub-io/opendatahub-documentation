= Running a workload with a Kueue-enabled hardware profile

[role="_abstract"]
You can run a workbench or deploy a model from the {productname-short} dashboard using a hardware profile that submits workloads to Kueue.

.Prerequisites
* A hardware profile configured for Kueue-based scheduling is available.
* You are working in a project that is opted in to Kueue management.

.Procedure

ifdef::upstream[]
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, begin the process to create a workbench or deploy a model, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working-on-projects/#creating-a-workbench-select-ide_projects[Creating a workbench and selecting an IDE] and link:{odhdocshome}/deploying-models/#deploying-models-using-the-model-serving-platform_odh-user[Enabling the model serving platform^].
endif::[]

ifndef::upstream[]
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, begin the process to create a workbench or deploy a model, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_projects/using-project-workbenches_projects#creating-a-workbench-select-ide_projects[Creating a workbench and selecting an IDE] and link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/deploying_models/deploying_models_on_the_single_model_serving_platform#deploying-models-on-the-model-serving-platform_rhoai-user[Deploying models on the model serving platform].
endif::[]
. When configuring the resources for your workload, select a hardware profile that is configured for Kueue-based scheduling from the *Hardware profile* list.
. Complete the remaining configuration and launch the workload.

.Verification
* The workload is submitted to the `LocalQueue` specified in the hardware profile.
* The workload starts when the required cluster resources are available and admitted by the queue.
