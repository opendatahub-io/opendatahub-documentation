= Updating cluster storage

[role='_abstract']
If your data science work requires you to change the identifying information of a project's cluster storage or the workbench that the storage is connected to, you can update your project's cluster storage to change these properties.

NOTE: You cannot directly change the *storage class* for cluster storage that is already configured for a workbench or project. To switch to a different storage class, you need to migrate your data to a new cluster storage instance that uses the required storage class.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
* You have created a project that contains cluster storage.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Projects*.
+
The *Projects* page opens.
. Click the name of the project whose storage you want to update.
+
A project details page opens.
. Click the *Cluster storage* tab.
. Click the action menu (*&#8942;*) beside the storage that you want to update and then click *Edit storage*.
+
The *Update cluster storage* page opens.
. Optional: Edit the *Name* field to change the display name for your storage.
. Optional: Edit the *Description* field to change the description of your storage.
. Optional: In the *Persistent storage size* section, specify a new size in gibibytes or mebibytes.
+
Note that you can only increase the storage size. Updating the storage size restarts the workbench and makes it unavailable for a period of time that is usually proportional to the size change.
. Optional: If you want to connect the cluster storage to a different workbench:
.. In the *Workbench connections* section, click *Add workbench*.
.. In the *Name* field, select an existing workbench from the list.
.. In the *Path format* field, select *Standard* if your storage directory begins with `/opt/app-root/src`, otherwise select *Custom*.
.. In the *Mount path* field, enter the path to a model or directory within a container where a volume is mounted and accessible. The path must consist of lowercase alphanumeric characters or `-`. Use `/` to indicate subdirectories.
. Click *Update storage*.

If you increased the storage size, the workbench restarts and is unavailable for a period of time that is usually proportional to the size change.

.Verification
* The storage that you updated is displayed on the *Cluster storage* tab for the project.
