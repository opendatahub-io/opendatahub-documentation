= Updating cluster storage

[role='_abstract']
If your data science work requires you to change the identifying information of a project's cluster storage or the workbench that the storage is connected to, you can update your project's cluster storage to change these properties.

NOTE: You cannot directly change the *storage class* for cluster storage that is already configured for a workbench or project. To switch to a different storage class, you need to migrate your data to a new cluster storage instance that uses the required storage class.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* You have created a data science project that contains cluster storage.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Data Science Projects*.
+
The *Data Science Projects* page opens.
. Click the name of the project whose storage you want to update.
+
A project details page opens.
. Click the *Cluster storage* tab.
. Click the action menu (*&#8942;*) beside the storage that you want to update and then click *Edit storage*.
+
The *Update cluster storage* page opens.
. Optional: Edit the *Name* field to change the display name for your storage.
. Optional: Edit the *Description* field to change the description of your storage.
. Optional: In the *Persistent storage size* section, specify a new size in gibibytes or mebibytes.
+
Note that you can only increase the storage size. Updating the storage size restarts the workbench and makes it unavailable for a period of time that is usually proportional to the size change.
. Optional: If you want to connect the cluster storage to a different workbench:
.. From the *Connected workbench* list, select the workbench.
.. In the *Mount folder name* field, enter the name of storage directory.
. Click *Update*.

If you increased the storage size, the workbench restarts and is unavailable for a period of time that is usually proportional to the size change.

.Verification
* The storage that you updated appears on the *Cluster storage* tab for the project.
