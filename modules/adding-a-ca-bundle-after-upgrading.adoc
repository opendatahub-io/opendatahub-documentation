You can use self-signed certificates in {productname-short}. If you have upgraded from {productname-short} 2.7 or earlier versions, you can add self-signed certificates to the {productname-short} deployments and data science projects in your cluster.

You can use self-signed certificates in {productname-short}. If you have upgraded {productname-short}, you can add self-signed certificates to the {productname-short} deployments and data science projects in your cluster. 
endif::[]

There are two ways to add a Certificate Authority (CA) bundle to {productname-short}. You can use one or both of these methods:

* For {openshift-platform} clusters that rely on self-signed certificates, you can add those self-signed certificates to a cluster-wide Certificate Authority (CA) bundle (`ca-bundle.crt`) and use the CA bundle in {productname-long}. 

* You can use self-signed certificates in a custom CA bundle (`odh-ca-bundle.crt`) that is separate from the cluster-wide bundle.

.Prerequisites
* You have admin access to the `DSCInitialization` resources in the {openshift-platform} cluster.
* You installed the OpenShift command line interface (`oc`) as described in link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI^].

ifdef::upstream[]
* You upgraded {productname-long}. If you are working in a new installation of {productname-long}, see link:{odhdocshome}/installing-open-data-hub/#adding-a-ca-bundle_certs[Understanding certificates in {productname-short}].
endif::[]

.Procedure
. Log in to the {openshift-platform} as a cluster administrator.
. Click *Operators* â†’ *Installed Operators* and then click the {productname-long} Operator.
. Click the *DSC Initialization* tab.
. Click the *default-dsci* object.
. Click the *YAML* tab.
. Add the following to the `spec` section, setting the `managementState` field to `Managed`:
+
[source]
----
spec:
  trustedCABundle:
    managementState: Managed
    customCABundle: ""
----
. If you want to use self-signed certificates added to a cluster-wide CA bundle, log in to the {openshift-platform} as a cluster administrator and follow the steps as described in link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/networking/configuring-a-custom-pki#installation-configure-proxy_configuring-a-custom-pki[Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation^].
. If you want to use self-signed certificates in a custom CA bundle that is separate from the cluster-wide bundle, follow these steps:
.. Add the custom certificate to the `customCABundle` field of the `default-dsci` object, as shown in the following example:
+
[source]
----
spec:
  trustedCABundle:
    managementState: Managed
    customCABundle: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      examplebundle123
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----
.. Click *Save*.
+
The {productname-long} Operator creates an `odh-trusted-ca-bundle` ConfigMap containing the certificates in all new and existing non-reserved namespaces.

.Verification
* If you are using a cluster-wide CA bundle, run the following command to verify that all non-reserved namespaces contain the `odh-trusted-ca-bundle` ConfigMap:
+
[source]
----
$ oc get configmaps --all-namespaces -l app.kubernetes.io/part-of=opendatahub-operator | grep odh-trusted-ca-bundle
----
* If you are using a custom CA bundle, run the following command to verify that a non-reserved namespace contains the `odh-trusted-ca-bundle` ConfigMap and that the ConfigMap contains your `customCABundle` value. In the following command, _example-namespace_ is the non-reserved namespace and _examplebundle123_ is the customCABundle value.
+
[source]
----

$ oc get configmap odh-trusted-ca-bundle -n example-namespace -o yaml | grep examplebundle123
----
