[role='_abstract']
To get started with data processing with Docling explore the provided examples.

*Prerequisites*

* Install the data processing library, as described in Set up your working environment.

*Procedure*

. To access the data processing examples, clone the data processing Git repository:
+
* To clone the repository from JupyterLab, follow the steps in xref:2.4.1[Clone an example Git repository] and specify the 3.0 branch.
* To create a local clone of the repository, run the following command:

git clone https://github.com/opendatahub-io/data-processing -b stable-3.0
----
. Go to the `notebooks` directory to learn how to use Docling for the following tasks:

*Use cases*

* Convert unstructured documents (PDF files) to structured format (Markdown) - with and with out vision‑language model (VLM)
* Chunk - Split documents into smaller, semantically meaningful pieces
* Information extraction - Use template formats to extract specific data fields from documents like invoices.
* Subset selection - Identify representative samples from large datasets.

*Tutorials* - An example notebook that provides a complete, end-to-end workflow for preparing a dataset of documents for a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.
