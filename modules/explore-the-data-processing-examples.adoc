. Go to the link:https://github.com/opendatahub-io/data-processing/tree/main/notebooks[`notebooks`] directory to learn how to use Docling for the following tasks:
+
link:https://github.com/opendatahub-io/data-processing/tree/main/notebooks/use-cases[*Use cases*]

* Convert unstructured documents (PDF files) to structured format (Markdown) - with and without vision‑language model (VLM)
* Chunk - Split documents into smaller, semantically meaningful pieces
* Information extraction - Use template formats to extract specific data fields from documents like invoices.
* Subset selection - Use this script or notebook to reduce the size of your dataset. The algorithm analyzes an input dataset and reduces it in size, while ensuring data diversity and coverage.

+
link:https://github.com/opendatahub-io/data-processing/tree/main/notebooks/tutorials[*Tutorials*] - An example notebook that provides a complete, end-to-end workflow for preparing a dataset of documents for a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.
