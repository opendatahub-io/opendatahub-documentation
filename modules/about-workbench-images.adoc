= About workbench images

[role="_abstract"]
A workbench image is preinstalled with the tools and libraries that you need for model development. You can use the provided workbench images or an {productname-short} administrator can create custom workbench images adapted to your needs.

To provide a consistent, stable platform for your model development, many provided workbench images contain the same version of Python. Most workbench images available on {productname-short} are pre-built and ready for you to use immediately after {productname-short} is installed or upgraded. 

ifndef::upstream[]
For information about Red Hat support of workbench images and packages, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhoai-supported-configs[{productname-long}: Supported Configurations].
endif::[]

The following table lists the workbench images that are installed with {productname-long} by default.

If the preinstalled packages that are provided in these images are not sufficient for your use case, you have the following options:

* Install additional libraries after launching a default image. This option is good if you want to add libraries on an ad hoc basis as you develop models. However, it can be challenging to manage the dependencies of installed libraries and your changes are not saved when the workbench restarts.

ifdef::upstream[]
* Create a custom image that includes the additional libraries or packages. For more information, see link:{odhdocshome}/managing-resources/#creating-custom-workbench-images_custom-images[Creating custom workbench images].

TensorFlow contains advanced data visualization features, such as computational graph visualizations. It also allows you to easily monitor and track the progress of your models.

| PyTorch
| PyTorch is an open source machine learning library optimized for deep learning. If you are working with computer vision or natural language processing models, use the Pytorch workbench image.

| Minimal Python
| If you do not require advanced machine learning features, or additional resources for compute-intensive data science work, you can use the Minimal Python image to develop your models.

| TrustyAI
| Use the TrustyAI workbench image to leverage your data science work with model explainability, tracing, and accountability, and runtime monitoring. See the link:https://github.com/trustyai-explainability/trustyai-explainability-python-examples[TrustyAI Explainability repository^] for some example Jupyter notebooks.

| code-server 
| With the code-server workbench image, you can customize your workbench environment to meet your needs using a variety of extensions to add new languages, themes, debuggers, and connect to additional services. Enhance the efficiency of your data science work with syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, and bracket matching, as well as an automatic task runner for seamless automation. For more information, see link:https://github.com/coder/code-server[code-server in GitHub]. +

NOTE: Elyra-based pipelines are not available with the code-server workbench image.
