= About organizing features by using entities
 
Within a feature view, you can group features that share a conceptual link or relationship together to define an entity. You can think of an entity as a primary key that you can use to fetch features. Typically, an entity maps to the domain of your use case. For example, a fraud detection use case could have customers and transactions as their entities, with group-related features that correspond to these customers and transactions.

A feature does not have to be associated with an entity. For example, a feature of a customer entity could be the number of transactions they have made on an average month, while a feature that is not observed on a specific entity could be the total number of transactions made by all users in the last month.

----
customer = Entity(name='dob_ssn', join_keys=['dob_ssn'])
----

The entity name uniquely identifies the entity. The join key identifies the physical primary key on which feature values are joined together for feature retrieval.

The following table shows example data with a single entity column (`dob_ssn`) and two feature columns (`credit_card_due` and `bankruptcies`).
