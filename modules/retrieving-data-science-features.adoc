= Retrieving data science features 
You can connect to the Feature Store and consume the features necessary for model development and inference. 

.Prerequisites
* Your Feature Store has been deployed.
* User access permissions have been configured by the administrator.
* You have access to a relevant Data Science Project (DSP) and a workbench.
* Your Feature Store client configuration must be complete.

.Procedure
Use this procedure to establish a secure, automated connection to the Feature Store directly from your workbench. You can perform essential tasks such as verifying successful authentication, identifying available features, and retrieving feature data for your machine learning projects.

. Login to the {productname-short} Dashboard.
. Navigate to Data Science Projects (DSP) and choose the project you plan to work on.
. Create a new workbench or open an existing workbench with the Feast software development kit (SDK).
.. In the Feature Store client configuration table, select the configmaps associated with the desired repositories.
.. Copy the Python script that is generated on the left side of the page.
that is generated on the left of the page.
.. Click the **Workbenches** tab and launch a workbench.
.. Paste the Python script into the workbench cell.

.Self-Authentication to Feature Store
You do not need tokens or manual authentication for the Feature Store. Your workbench automatically authenticates using the access your administrator granted to your Data Science Project.

NOTE: Feast SDK is available in all images except minimal.

.Verification
If your procedure is successful, you will see a green checkmark and "Authenticated successfully," or a red X and "Authentication failed."
