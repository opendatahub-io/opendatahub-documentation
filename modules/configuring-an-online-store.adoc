= Configuring an online store

[role='_abstract']
When you create a Feature Store instance using the minimal configuration, by default, the online store is a SQLite database.

The example in the following procedure shows how to configure a PostgreSQL database for the online store.

You can configure other online stores, such as Snowflake, Redis, and DynamoDB, as detailed in the link:https://docs.feast.dev/v0.49-branch/reference/online-stores[Feast reference documentation for online stores^].

NOTE: The example code in the following procedure requires that you edit it with values that are specific to your use case.

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator privileges for your {openshift-platform} cluster.

* You have enabled the Feature Store component, as described in _Enabling the Feature Store component_.

ifndef::upstream[]
* You have created a project, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_projects/using-projects_projects#creating-a-project_projects[Creating a project]. In the following procedure, `my-project` is the name of the project.
endif::[]

ifdef::upstream[]
* You have created a project, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working-on-projects/#creating-a-project_projects[Creating a project]. In the following procedure, `my-project` is the name of the project.
endif::[]

* Your project includes an existing secret that provides credentials for accessing the database that you want to use for the online store. The example in the following procedure requires that you have configured a PostgreSQL database.
