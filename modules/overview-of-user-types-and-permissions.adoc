| Administrators
a| In addition to the actions permitted to a data scientist, administrators can perform these actions:

* Configure {productname-long} settings.
* Access and manage notebook servers.

By default, all OpenShift users have access to {productname-long}. In addition, users in the {openshift-platform} administrator group (by default, `dedicated-admins`), automatically have administrator access in {productname-short}.

Optionally, if you want to restrict access to your {productname-short} deployment, you can create specialized user groups for users and administrators.

If you decide to restrict access, and you already have user groups defined in your configured identity provider, you can add these user groups to your {productname-short} deployment. If you decide to use specialized user groups without adding these groups from an identity provider, you must create the groups in {openshift-platform} and then add users to them.

ifndef::self-managed[]
The user groups configured in {openshift-platform}, `cluster-admins` and `dedicated-admins`, are separate to any specialized {productname-short} user groups. There are some operations relevant to {productname-short} that require the `cluster-admins` or `dedicated-admins` role. Those operations include:

* Adding users to the {productname-short} user and administrator groups, if you are using specialized groups.
* Removing users from the {productname-short} user and administrator groups, if you are using specialized groups.
* Managing custom environment and storage configuration for users in {openshift-platform}, such as Jupyter notebook resources, ConfigMaps, and persistent volume claims (PVCs).

//For RHODS-1954
[IMPORTANT]
====
Although users of {productname-short} and its components are authenticated through OpenShift, session management is separate from authentication. This means that logging out of {openshift-platform} or {productname-short} does not affect a logged in Jupyter session running on those platforms. This means that when a user's permissions change, that user must log out of all current sessions in order for the changes to take effect.
