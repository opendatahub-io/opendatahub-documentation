Table 1 describes the {productname-long} user types.

| User Type | Permissions

| Users
| Machine learning operations (MLOps) engineers and data scientists can access and use individual components of {productname-long}, such as workbenches and data science pipelines.

| Administrators
a| In addition to the actions permitted to users, administrators can perform these actions:

* Configure {productname-long} settings.
* Access and manage notebook servers.
* Access and manage data science pipeline applications for any data science project.
|===

By default, all OpenShift users have access to {productname-long}. In addition, users in the OpenShift administrator group (`cluster admins`), automatically have administrator access in {productname-short}.

Optionally, if you want to restrict access to your {productname-short} deployment to specific users or groups, you can create user groups for users and administrators.

ifdef::cloud-service[]

If you decide to restrict access, and you already have user groups defined in your configured identity provider, you can add these user groups to your {productname-short} deployment. If you decide to use  user groups without adding these groups from an identity provider, you must create the groups in OpenShift and then add users to them.

There are some operations relevant to {productname-short} that require the `cluster-admins` role. Those operations include:

* Adding users to the {productname-short} user and administrator groups.
* Removing users from the {productname-short} user and administrator groups.
* Managing custom environment and storage configuration for users in OpenShift, such as Jupyter notebook resources, ConfigMaps, and persistent volume claims (PVCs).
* Managing data science pipeline servers and pipeline applications from the {productname-short} dashboard, or from the command-line interface (CLI), for any data science project. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Although users of {productname-short} and its components are authenticated through OpenShift, session management is separate from authentication. This means that logging out of OpenShift or {productname-short} does not affect a logged in Jupyter session running on those platforms. This means that when a user's permissions change, that user must log out of all current sessions in order for the changes to take effect.
