[role='_abstract']
By adding an Open Data Hub instance to your project, you can access the URL for your Open Data Hub dashboard and share it with data science users.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the Open Data Hub Operator.
* You have created a new project for your instance of Open Data Hub.

.Procedure
. In the OpenShift web console, select *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*. 
. On the *Installed Operators* page, click the *Project* list and select the `odh` project. The page filters to only display installed operators  in the `odh` project.
. Find and click the *Open Data Hub Operator* to display the details for the currently installed version.
. On the *KfDef* tile, click *Create instance*. A `KfDef` object is a specification designed to control provisioning and management of a Kubeflow deployment. A default `KfDef` object is created when you install Open Data Hub Operator. This default configuration deploys the required Open Data Hub core components. For more information, see link:https://opendatahub.io/docs/tiered-components[Tiered Components].
. On the *Create KfDef* page, leave *opendatahub* as the name. Click *Create* to create an Open Data Hub kfdef object named *opendatahub* and begin the deployment of the components.

.Verification
. Select *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. On the *Installed Operators* page, click the *Project* list and select the `odh` project.
. Find and click *Open Data Hub Operator*.
. Click the *Kf Def* tab and confirm that *opendatahub* appears.
. Select *Home* -> *Projects*.
