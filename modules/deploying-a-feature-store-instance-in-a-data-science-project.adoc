= Deploying a feature store instance in a data science project

[role='_abstract']
You can add an instance of Feature Store to a data science project by creating a custom resource definition (CRD) in the OpenShift console.

The following example shows the minimum requirements for a Feature Store CRD YAML file:
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: feast.dev/v1alpha1
kind: FeatureStore
metadata:
  name: sample
spec:
  feastProject: my_feast_project
----

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator privileges for your {openshift-platform} cluster.

* You have enabled the Feature Store component, as described in link:[Enabling the Feature Store component].

* You have created a data science project, as described in link:[Creating a data science project]. In the following procedure, `my_ds_project` is the name of the data science project.

.Procedure

. In the OpenShift console, click the *Quick Create* (image:images/quick-create-icon.png[]) icon and then click the *Import YAML* option.

. Verify that your data science project is the selected project.

. Copy the following code and paste it into the YAML editor:
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: feast.dev/v1alpha1
kind: FeatureStore
metadata:
  name: sample 
spec:
  feastProject: my_feast_project 
----

. Optionally, change the `metadata.name` for the feature store instance.
. Optionally, edit the name of the feature project that you want to use for organizing your Feature Store code.
. Click *Create*.

When you create the Feature Store CRD file in OpenShift, Feature Store starts a remote online feature server, and configures a default registry and an offline store with the local provider. 

A _provider_ is a customizable interface that provides default Feature Store components, such as the registry, offline store, and online store, that target a specific environment, ensuring that these components can work together seamlessly. The local provider uses the following default settings:

* Registry: A SQL registry or local file
* Offline store:  A Parquet file
* Online store: SQLite

.Verification
Follow these steps to verify that you added Feature Store to your data science project:

. In the {openshift-platform} console, select *Workloads* -> *Pods*.
. Make sure that your data science project (for example, my_ds_project) is selected.
. Click the feast pod and then select Pod details. 
. Scroll down to see the online container. This container is the deployment for the online server. It makes the feature server REST API available in the OpenShift cluster.
. Scroll up and then click Terminal.
. In the Terminal window, enter the following commands.
. To view the files for the feature store project, enter the following command:
+
----
$ ls -la
----

. You should see output similar to the following:
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-output]
[source, yaml]
----
.
..
data
example_repo.py
feature_store.yaml
__init__.py
__pycache__
test_workflow.py
----

. To view the `feature_store.yaml`` configuration file, enter the following command:
+
----
$ cat feature_store.yaml
----
+
You should see output similar to the following:
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-output]
[source, yaml]
----
project: my_feast_project
provider: local
online_store:
	path: /feast-data/online_store.db
	type: sqlite
registry:
	path: /feast-data/registry.db
	registry_type: file
auth:
	type: no_auth
entity_key_serialization_version: 3
----
+
*NOTE:* Although the offline_store service is not shown in the `feature_store.yaml` file, the feature store instance uses a DASK file-based store and although the registry type is `file`, it uses a simple SQL lite database.

.Next steps

If you want to customize the default configurations for the offline store, online store, or registry, you can edit the YAML configuration for the Feature Store CRD, as described in link:[Customizing your feature store configuration].
