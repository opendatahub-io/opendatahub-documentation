** If you are a data scientist user, your administrator must provide you with the {productname-short} instance URL, for example, `https://rhoai-dashboard-redhat-oai-applications.apps.example.abc1.p1.openshiftapps.com/`
endif::[]
** If you have access to {openshift-platform}, you can browse to the {openshift-platform} web console and click the *Application Launcher* (image:images/osd-app-launcher.png[The application launcher]) -> *{productname-long}*.
