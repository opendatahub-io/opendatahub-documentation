= Logging in to Open Data Hub

[role='_abstract']
Log in to {productname-short} from a browser for easy access to Jupyter and your data science projects.

.Procedure
. Browse to the {productname-short} instance URL and click *Log in with OpenShift*.
** If you are a data scientist user, your administrator must provide you with the {productname-short} instance URL, for example, `https:://odh-dashboard-odh.apps.ocp4.example.com`.
** If you have access to {openshift-platform}, you can browse to the {openshift-platform} web console and click the *Application Launcher* (image:{site-baseurl}/assets/img/pages/docs/images/osd-app-launcher.png[The application launcher]) -> *{productname-long}*.

. Click the name of your identity provider, for example, `GitHub`.
. Enter your credentials and click *Log in* (or equivalent for your identity provider).
+

If you have not previously authorized the `odh-dashboard` service account to access your account, the *Authorize Access* page appears prompting you to provide authorization.
Inspect the permissions selected by default, and click the *Allow selected permissions* button.


.Verification
* {productname-short} opens on the *Enabled applications* page.

.Troubleshooting
* If you see `An authentication error occurred` or `Could not create user` when you try to log in:
** You might have entered your credentials incorrectly. Confirm that your credentials are correct.
** You might have an account in more than one configured identity provider. If you have logged in with a different identity provider previously, try again with that identity provider.
