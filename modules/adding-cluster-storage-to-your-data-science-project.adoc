= Adding cluster storage to your data science project

[role='_abstract']
For data science projects that require data to be retained, you can add cluster storage to the project. Additionally, you can also connect cluster storage to a specific project's workbench.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
* You have created a data science project that you can add cluster storage to.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Data science projects*.
+
The *Data science projects* page opens.
. Click the name of the project that you want to add the cluster storage to.
+
A project details page opens.
. Click the *Cluster storage* tab.
. Click *Add cluster storage*.
+
The *Add cluster storage* dialog opens.
. In the *Name* field, enter a unique name for the cluster storage.
. Optional: In the *Description* field, enter a description for the cluster storage.
. From the *Storage class* list, select the type of cluster storage.
+
NOTE: You cannot change the storage class after you add the cluster storage to the project.

. For storage classes that support multiple access modes, select an *Access mode* to define how the volume can be accessed. For more information, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/managing_resources/managing-storage-classes#about-persistent-storage_resource-mgmt[About persistent storage].  
endif::[]

. For storage classes that support multiple access modes, select an *Access mode* to define how the volume can be accessed. For more information, see link:{odhdocshome}/managing-resources/#about-persistent-storage_managing-resources[About persistent storage]. 
endif::[]  
+
Only the access modes that have been enabled for the storage class by your cluster and {productname-short} administrators are visible.
+
. In the *Persistent storage size* section, specify a new size in gibibytes or mebibytes.
. Optional: If you want to connect the cluster storage to an existing workbench:
.. In the *Workbench connections* section, click *Add workbench*.
.. In the *Name* field, select an existing workbench from the list.
.. In the *Path format* field, select *Standard* if your storage directory begins with `/opt/app-root/src`, otherwise select *Custom*.
.. In the *Mount path* field, enter the path to a model or directory within a container where a volume is mounted and accessible. The path must consist of lowercase alphanumeric characters or `-`. Use `/` to indicate subdirectories.
. Click *Add storage*.

.Verification
* The cluster storage that you added is displayed on the *Cluster storage* tab for the project.
* A new persistent volume claim (PVC) is created with the storage size that you defined.
* The persistent volume claim (PVC) is visible as an attached storage on the *Workbenches* tab for the project.
