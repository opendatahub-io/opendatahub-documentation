= Adding cluster storage to your data science project

[role='_abstract']
For data science projects that require data to be retained, you can add cluster storage to the project. Additionally, you can also connect cluster storage to a specific project's workbench.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group}) in OpenShift.

* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* You have created a data science project that you can add cluster storage to.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Data Science Projects*.
+
The *Data Science Projects* page opens.
. Click the name of the project that you want to add the cluster storage to.
+
A project details page opens.
. Click the *Cluster storage* tab.
. Click *Add cluster storage*.
+
The *Add storage* dialog opens.
. Enter a *name* for the cluster storage.
. Enter a *description* for the cluster storage.
. Under *Persistent storage size*, enter a new size in gibibytes. The minimum size is 1 GiB, and the maximum size is 16384 GiB.
. Optional: Select a *workbench* from the list to connect the cluster storage to an existing workbench.
. If you selected a workbench to connect the storage to, enter the storage directory in the *Mount folder* field.
. Click *Add storage*.

.Verification
* The cluster storage that you added appears on the *Cluster storage* tab for the project.
