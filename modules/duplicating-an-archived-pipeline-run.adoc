= Duplicating an archived pipeline run

[role='_abstract']
To make it easier to reproduce runs with the same configuration as runs in your archive, you can duplicate them.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* You have previously created a data science project that is available and contains a configured pipeline server.
* You have imported a pipeline to an active pipeline server.
* An archived run is available to duplicate on the *Archived* tab on the *Runs* page.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Data Science Pipelines* -> *Runs*.
. On the *Runs* page, select the *project* that has the pipeline run that you want to duplicate.
. Click the *Archived* tab.
. Click the action menu (*&#8942;*) beside the relevant archived run and click *Duplicate*.
. On the *Duplicate run* page, configure the duplicate run:
.. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the duplicate run.
.. In the *Description* field, enter a description for the duplicate run.
.. From the *Pipeline* list, select the pipeline to contain the duplicate run.
.. From the *Pipeline version* list, select the pipeline version to contain the duplicate run.
.. In the *Parameters* section, configure the input parameters for the run that you are duplicating by selecting the appropriate parameters from the list.
.. Click *Create run*.

.Verification
* The duplicate pipeline run appears on the *Active* tab on the *Runs* page.
