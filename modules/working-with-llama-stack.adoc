= Working with Llama Stack

[role="_abstract"]
Llama Stack is a unified AI runtime environment designed to simplify the deployment and management of generative AI workloads on {productname-short}. Llama Stack integrates LLM inference servers, vector databases, and retrieval services in a single stack, optimized for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agent-based AI workflows. In {openshift-platform}, the Llama Stack Operator manages the deployment lifecycle of these components, ensuring scalability, consistency, and integration with {productname-short} projects.

Technology Preview features are not supported with {org-name} production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete.
{org-name} does not recommend using them in production.
These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

Llama Stack includes the following components:

* **Inference model servers** such as vLLM, designed to efficiently serve large language models.
* **Vector storage** solutions, primarily Milvus, to store embeddings generated from your domain data.
* **Retrieval and embedding management** workflows using integrated tools, such as Docling, to handle continuous data ingestion and synchronization.
* **Integration with the {productname-short}** by using the `LlamaStackDistribution` custom resource, simplifying configuration and deployment.
