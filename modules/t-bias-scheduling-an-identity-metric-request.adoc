= Scheduling an identity metric request

You can monitor the average values of various data fields over time to see the average ratio of loan-payback to loan-default predictions and the average ratio of male-identifying to non-male-identifying applicants. To monitor the average values, you create an identity metric request by sending a POST request to the `/metrics/identity/request` endpoint.

.Procedure
* In a terminal window, run the following command from the directory containing the downloaded tutorial files (`odh-trustyai-demos-main`):

----
for model in "demo-loan-nn-onnx-alpha" "demo-loan-nn-onnx-beta"; do
  for field in "Is Male-Identifying?" "Will Default?"; do
      curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" -X POST --location $TRUSTY_ROUTE/metrics/identity/request \
       --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
       --data "{
                 \"columnName\": \"$field\",
                 \"batchSize\": 250,
                 \"modelId\": \"$model\"
               }"
	echo -e
  done
done
----

The payload structure is as follows:

* `columnName`: The name of the field to compute the averaging over.
* `batchSize`: The number of previous inferences to include in the average-value calculation.
* `modelId`: The name of the model to query.

.Verification

. In the {openshift-platform} web console, click *Observe* -> *Metrics*.
. In the *Expression* field, enter `trustyai_identity` and click *Run Queries*. 
. Optional: After running a query, you can select a time range and refresh interval.
  * From the *Time range* list, select 5 minutes.
  * From the *Refresh interval* list, select 15 seconds.
