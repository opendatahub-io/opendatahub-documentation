= Adding users to specialized {productname-short} user groups

By default, all OpenShift users have access to {productname-long}. 

Optionally, you can restrict user access to your {productname-short} instance by defining specialized user groups. You must grant users permission to access {productname-long} by adding user accounts to the {productname-long} user group, administrator group, or both. You can either use the default group name, or specify a group name that already exists in your identity provider.

The *user group* provides the user with access to developer functions in the {productname-long} dashboard, and associated services, such as Jupyter.

The *administrator group* provides the user with access to developer and administrator functions in the {productname-long} dashboard and associated services, such as Jupyter.

If you restrict access by using specialized user groups, users that are not in the {productname-short} user group or administrator group can still view the dashboard, but are unable to use associated services, such as Jupyter. They are also unable to access the *Cluster settings* page.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using LDAP as your identity provider, you need to configure LDAP syncing to {openshift-platform}. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.13/html/authentication_and_authorization/ldap-syncing[Syncing LDAP groups] for more information.
