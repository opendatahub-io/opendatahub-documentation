= Installing Python packages on your notebook server in code-server

[role='_abstract']
You can install Python packages that are not part of the default notebook server by adding the package and the version to a `requirements.txt` file and then running the `pip install` command in a terminal window.

NOTE: You can also install packages directly, but {org-name} recommends using a `requirements.txt` file so that the packages stated in the file can be easily re-used across different notebooks. In addition, using a `requirements.txt` file is also useful when using a S2I build to deploy a model.

.Prerequisites
* A launched and running code-server notebook server.

.Procedure
. In your code-server workbench, from the Activity Bar, select the menu icon (image:images/codeserver-menu-icon.png[The Menu icon]) > *File* > *New Text File*  to create a new text file.
. Add the packages to install to the text file.

[NOTE]
====
{org-name} recommends specifying exact package versions to enhance the stability of your notebook server over time. New package versions can introduce undesirable or unexpected changes in your environment's behavior.

To install multiple packages at the same time, place each package on a separate line.
. Save the text file as `requirements.txt`.
. From the Activity Bar, select the menu icon (image:images/codeserver-menu-icon.png[The Menu icon]) > *Terminal* > *New Terminal*  to open a terminal window.
. Install the packages in `requirements.txt` to your server by using the following command:
+
[source]
----
pip install -r requirements.txt
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
This command installs the package on your notebook server, but you must still run the `import` directive to use the package in your code.

----
import altair
----
====

.Verification
* Confirm that the packages in `requirements.txt` appear in the list of packages installed on the notebook server.
