= Deploying models

. Navigate to the model-namespace created in the setup section: 
+
[source]
----
oc project model-namespace
----

. Deploy the model's storage container:
+
[source]
----
oc apply -f 2-BiasMonitoring/resources/model_storage_container.yaml
----

. Deploy the OVMS 1.x serving runtime: 
+
[source]
----
oc apply -f 2-BiasMonitoring/resources/ovms-1.x.yaml
----

. Deploy the first model: 
+
[source]
----
oc apply -f 2-BiasMonitoring/resources/model_alpha.yaml
----

. Deploy the second model: 
+
[source]
----
oc apply -f 2-BiasMonitoring/resources/model_beta.yaml
----

. From the OpenShift Console, navigate to the model-namespace project and look at the Workloads -> Pods screen.

* You should see four pods: 
    ** `minio`
    ** `modelmesh-serving-ovms-1.x-75d7cf6765-nlps8`
    ** `modelmesh-serving-ovms-1.x-75d7cf6765-s4rnk`
    ** `trustyai-service-6c9dc58bbf-rszrv`

* Once the TrustyAI Service registers the deployed models, you will see the  `modelmesh-serving-ovms-1.x-xxxxx` pods get re-deployed.
* Verify that the models are registered with TrustyAI by selecting one of the `modelmesh-serving-ovms-1.x-xxxxx pods`. In the Environment tab, if the field `MM_PAYLOAD_PROCESSORS` is set, then your models are successfully registered with TrustyAI:
