= Creating a hardware profile

[role='_abstract']
To configure specific hardware configurations for your data scientists to use in {productname-short}, you must create an associated hardware profile.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-short} as a user with {productname-short} administrator privileges.
* The relevant hardware is installed and you have confirmed that it is detected in your environment.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Settings* -> *Hardware profiles*.
+
The *Hardware profiles* page appears, displaying existing hardware profiles. To enable or disable an existing hardware profile, on the row containing the relevant hardware profile, click the toggle in the *Enable* column.
. Click *Create hardware profile*. 
+
The *Create hardware profile* dialog appears.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the hardware profile.
. Optional: To change the default name of your Kubernetes resource, click *Edit resource name* and enter a name in the *Resource name* field. The resource name cannot be edited after creation.
. Optional: In the *Description* field, enter a description for the hardware profile.
. In the *Visiblity* section, set the hardware profile visibility level:
.. To access the hardware profile in all areas of {productname-short}, leave the *Visible everywhere* radio button selected.
.. Click the *Limited visibility* radio button to limit the areas of {productname-short} where your data scientists can use the hardware profile.
. Optional: Configure node resource request limits:
.. Click *Add resource*. 
+
The *Add resource* dialog opens.
.. In the *Resource label* field, enter a unique resource label. 
.. In the *Resource identifier* field, enter a unique resource identifier. 
.. From the *Resource type* field, select x from the list. 
.. In the *Default* field, enter the default resource request limit. This value must be equal to or between the minimum and maximum limits.
.. In the *Minimum allowed* field, enter the minimum number of resources that users can request. 
.. In the *Maximum allowed* field, enter the maximum number of resources that users can request:
... To set a specific maximum request limit, click the *Set maximum limit* radio button and enter a value.
... To set no maximum request limit, click the *No maximum limit* radio button.
.. Click *Add*.
. Optional: Add a node selector to schedule pods on nodes with matching labels.
.. Click *Add node selector*. 
+
The *Add node selector* dialog opens.
.. In the *Key* field, enter a node selection key. The key is any string, up to 253 characters. The key must begin with a letter or number, and may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores.
.. In the *Value* field, enter a node selection value. The value is any string, up to 63 characters. The value must begin with a letter or number, and may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores.
.. Click *Add*.
. Optional: Add a toleration to schedule pods with matching taints.
.. Click *Add toleration*. 
+
The *Add toleration* dialog opens.
.. From the *Operator* list, select one of the following options:
* *Equal* - The *key/value/effect* parameters must match. This is the default.
* *Exists* - The *key/effect* parameters must match. You must leave a blank value parameter, which matches any.
.. From the *Effect* list, select one of the following options:
* *None* 
* *NoSchedule* - New pods that do not match the taint are not scheduled onto that node. Existing pods on the node remain.
* *PreferNoSchedule* - New pods that do not match the taint might be scheduled onto that node, but the scheduler tries not to. Existing pods on the node remain.
* *NoExecute* - New pods that do not match the taint cannot be scheduled onto that node. Existing pods on the node that do not have a matching toleration are removed.
.. In the *Key* field, enter a toleration key. The key is any string, up to 253 characters. The key must begin with a letter or number, and may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores.
.. In the *Value* field, enter a toleration value. The value is any string, up to 63 characters. The value must begin with a letter or number, and may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores.
.. In the *Toleration Seconds* section, select one of the following options to specify how long a pod stays bound to a node that has a node condition:
** *Forever* - Pods stays permanently bound to a node. 
** *Custom value* - Enter a value, in seconds, to define how long pods stay bound to a node that has a node condition.
.. Click *Add*.
. Click *Create hardware profile*.

.Verification
* The hardware profile appears on the *Hardware profiles* page.
* The hardware profile appears in the *Hardware profiles* list on the *Create workbench* page.
* The hardware profile appears on the *Instances* tab on the details page for the `HardwareProfile` custom resource definition (CRD).
