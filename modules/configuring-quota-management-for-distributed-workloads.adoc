* You have created a data science project that contains a workbench, and the workbench is running a default notebook image that contains the CodeFlare SDK, for example, the *Standard Data Science* notebook.

* You have sufficient resources. In addition to the base {productname-short} resources, you need 1.6 vCPU and 2 GiB memory to deploy the distributed workloads infrastructure.

* The resources are physically available in the cluster.

[NOTE]

In {productname-short} {vernum}, {org-name} supports only a single cluster queue per cluster (that is, homogenous clusters), and only empty resource flavors.

.Procedure

. In a terminal window, if you are not already logged in to your OpenShift cluster as a cluster administrator, log in to the OpenShift CLI as shown in the following example:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc login __<openshift_cluster_url>__ -u __<admin_username>__ -p __<password>__
----

. Create an empty Kueue resource flavor, as follows:
.. Create a file called `default_flavor.yaml` and populate it with the following content:
+
.Empty Kueue resource flavor
[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ResourceFlavor
metadata:
  name: default-flavor
----
.. Apply the configuration to create the `default-flavor` object:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc apply -f default_flavor.yaml
----

. Create a cluster queue to manage the empty Kueue resource flavor, as follows:
.. Create a file called `cluster_queue.yaml` and populate it with the following content:
+
.Example cluster queue
[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterQueue
metadata:
  name: "cluster-queue"
spec:
  namespaceSelector: {}  # match all.
  resourceGroups:
  - coveredResources: ["cpu", "memory", "nvidia.com/gpu"]
    flavors:
    - name: "default-flavor"
      resources:
      - name: "cpu"
        nominalQuota: 9
      - name: "memory"
        nominalQuota: 36Gi
      - name: "nvidia.com/gpu"
        nominalQuota: 5
----
+
.. Replace the example quota values (9 CPUs, 36 GiB memory, and 5 NVIDIA GPUs) with the appropriate values for your cluster queue.
The cluster queue will start a distributed workload only if the total required resources are within these quota limits.
+
You must specify a quota for each resource that the user can request, even if the requested value is 0, by updating the `spec.resourceGroups` section as follows:

* Include the resource name in the `coveredResources` list.
* Specify the resource `name` and `nominalQuota` in the `flavors.resources` section, even if the `nominalQuota` value is 0.

.. Apply the configuration to create the `cluster-queue` object:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc apply -f cluster_queue.yaml
----

. Create a local queue that points to your cluster queue, as follows:
.. Create a file called `local_queue.yaml` and populate it with the following content:
+
.Example local queue
[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: LocalQueue
metadata:
  namespace: test
  name: local-queue-test
  annotations:
    kueue.x-k8s.io/default-queue: 'true'
spec:
  clusterQueue: cluster-queue
----
The `kueue.x-k8s.io/default-queue: 'true'` annotation defines this queue as the default queue.
Distributed workloads are submitted to this queue if no `local_queue` value is specified in the `ClusterConfiguration` section of the data science pipeline or Jupyter notebook or Microsoft Visual Studio Code file.
.. Update the `namespace` value to specify the same namespace as in the `ClusterConfiguration` section that creates the Ray cluster.
.. Optional: Update the `name` value accordingly.
.. Apply the configuration to create the local-queue object:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc apply -f local_queue.yaml
----
+
The cluster queue allocates the resources to run distributed workloads in the local queue.


.Verification
Check the status of the local queue in a project, as follows:

[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc get -n __<project-name>__ localqueues
----
