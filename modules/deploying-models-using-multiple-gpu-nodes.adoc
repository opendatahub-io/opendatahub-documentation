= Deploying models using multiple GPU nodes

[role='_abstract']
Deploying models using multiple graphical processing units (GPUs) across multiple nodes can help when deploying large models such as large language models (LLMs).

This procedure shows you how to serve models on {productname-long} across multiple GPU nodes using the vLLM serving framework. Multi-node inferencing uses the `vllm-multinode-runtime` ServingRuntime as a custom runtime. The `vllm-multinode-runtime` ServingRuntime uses the same vLLM image as the `vllm-runtime` and also includes information necessary for multi-GPU inferencing.

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Deploying models using multiple GPU nodes* is currently available in {productname-long} as a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with {org-name} production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. {org-name} does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of {org-name} Technology Preview features, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview Features Support Scope]

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator privileges for your {openshift-platform} cluster.
* You have downloaded and installed the {openshift-platform} command-line interface (CLI). See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI^].

ifndef::upstream[]
* You have enabled the operators for your GPU type, such as Node Feature Discovery Operator, NVIDIA GPU Operator. For more information about enabling accelerators, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/managing_openshift_ai/enabling_accelerators[Enabling accelerators^].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* You have enabled the operators for your GPU type, such as Node Feature Discovery Operator, NVIDIA GPU Operator. For more information about enabling accelerators, see link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-accelerators[Working with accelerators^].
endif::[]

** You are using an NVIDIA GPU (`nvidia.com/gpu`).
** Specify the GPU type through either the `ServingRuntime` or `InferenceService`. If the GPU type specified in the `ServingRuntime` differs from what is set in the `InferenceService`, both GPU types are assigned to the resource and can cause errors. 
* You have enabled KServe on your cluster.
* You have only 1 head pod in your setup. Do not adjust the replica count using the `min_replicas` or `max_replicas` settings in the `InferenceService`. Creating additional head pods can cause them to be excluded from the Ray cluster.	
* You have a persistent volume claim (PVC) set up and configured for ReadWriteMany (RWX) access mode. 

.Procedure
. In a terminal window, if you are not already logged in to your {openshift-platform} cluster as a cluster administrator, log in to the {openshift-platform} CLI as shown in the following example:
+
[source]
----
$ oc login <openshift_cluster_url> -u <admin_username> -p <password>
----
+

. Select or create a namespace where you would like to deploy the model. In this example, `kserve-demo` is used and can be created using the following command:
+
[source]
----
oc new-project kserve-demo
----
+

. From the namespace where you would like to deploy the model, create a PVC for model storage and provide the name of your storage class. The storage class must be file storage.
+
NOTE: If you have already configured a PVC, you can skip this step.
+
[source]
----
kubectl apply -f -

  volumeMode: Filesystem
  resources:

      storage: 50Gi
  storageClassName: __<fileStorageClassName>__
----

. Download the model to the PVC. For example:

          value: 'false'
        - name: AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
          value: <region>
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/mnt/models/"
          name: model-volume
----
+

. Create the `vllm-multinode-runtime` ServingRuntime as a custom runtime:
+
[source]
----
oc process vllm-multinode-runtime-template -n redhat-ods-applications|oc apply  -f -
----
+

. Deploy the model using the following `InferenceService` configuration:
+
[source]
----
apiVersion: serving.kserve.io/v1beta1
kind: InferenceService
metadata:
  annotations:
    serving.kserve.io/deploymentMode: RawDeployment
    serving.kserve.io/autoscalerClass: external
  name: granite-8b-code-base-pvc
spec:
  predictor:
    model:
      modelFormat:
        name: vLLM
      runtime: vllm-multinode-runtime
      storageUri: pvc://granite-8b-code-base-pvc/hf/8b_instruction_tuned
    workerSpec: {}    
----
+
The following configuration can be added to the `InferenceService`:
+
* `workerSpec.tensorParallelSize`: Determines how many GPUs are used per node. The GPU type count in both the head and worker node deployment resources is updated automatically. Ensure that the value of `workerSpec.tensorParallelSize` is at least `1`.
* `workerSpec.pipelineParallelSize`: Determines how many nodes are involved in the deployment. This variable represents the total number of nodes, including both the head and worker nodes. Ensure that the value of `workerSpec.pipelineParallelSize` is at least `2`.


.Verification

To confirm that you have set up your environment to deploy models on multiple GPU nodes, check the GPU resource status, the `InferenceService` status, the ray cluster status, and send a request to the model.

* Check the GPU resource status:

** Retrieve the pod names for the head and worker nodes:
+
[source]
----
# Get pod name
podName=$(oc get pod -l app=isvc.granite-8b-code-base-pvc-predictor --no-headers|cut -d' ' -f1)
workerPodName=$(oc get pod -l app=isvc.granite-8b-code-base-pvc-predictor-worker --no-headers|cut -d' ' -f1)

oc wait --for=condition=ready pod/${podName} --timeout=300s
# Check the GPU memory size for both the head and worker pods:
echo "### HEAD NODE GPU Memory Size"
kubectl exec $podName -- nvidia-smi
echo "### Worker NODE GPU Memory Size"
kubectl exec $workerPodName -- nvidia-smi

Confirm that the model loaded properly by checking the values of <1> and <2>. If the model did not load, the value of these fields is `0MiB`.
