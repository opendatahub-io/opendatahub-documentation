= Viewing a deployed model

[role='_abstract']
To analyze the results of your work, you can view a list of deployed models on {productname-long}. You can also view the current statuses of deployed models and their endpoints.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Model Serving*.
+
The *Deployed models* page opens.
+
For each model, the page shows details such as the model name, the project in which the model is deployed, the model-serving runtime that the model uses, and the deployment status.
. Optional: For a given model, click the link in the *Inference endpoint* column to see the inference endpoints for the deployed model.

.Verification
* A list of previously deployed data science models is displayed on the *Deployed models* page.
