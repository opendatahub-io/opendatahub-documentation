= Viewing a deployed model

[role='_abstract']
To analyze the results of your work, you can view a list of deployed models on {productname-long}. You can also view the current statuses of deployed models and their endpoints.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Model Serving*.
+
The *Deployed models* page opens.
+
For each model, the page shows details such as the model name, the project in which the model is deployed, the serving runtime that the model uses, and the deployment status.
. Optional: For a given model, click the link in the *Inference endpoint* column to see the inference endpoints for the deployed model.

.Verification
* A list of previously deployed data science models is displayed on the *Deployed models* page.
