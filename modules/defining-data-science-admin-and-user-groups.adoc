= Defining {productname-short} administrator and user groups

By default, all users authenticated in OpenShift can access {productname-short}.

ifdef::cloud-service[]
Also by default, users with cluster admin permissions and users in the `dedicated-admins` administrator group are {productname-short} administrators.
A `cluster admin` is a superuser that can perform any action in any project in the OpenShift cluster. When bound to a user with a local binding, they have full control over quota and every action on every resource in the project. 
The `dedicated-admins` user group applies only to OpenShift Dedicated. 
endif::[]
ifdef::self-managed[]
Also by default, users with the `cluster-admin` role are {productname-short} administrators, but all users authenticated in OpenShift can access {productname-short}. A cluster admin is a superuser that can perform any action in any project in the OpenShift cluster. When bound to a user with a local binding, they have full control over quota and every action on every resource in the project.

You can define additional administrator and user groups by using the {productname-short} dashboard.


.Prerequisites

ifdef::upstream[]
* You have logged in to {productname-long} as described in link:{odhdocshome}/getting-started-with-open-data-hub/#logging-in_get-started[Logging in to {productname-short}].
endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
* You have logged in to {productname-long} as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/getting_started_with_{url-productname-long}/logging-in_get-started[Logging in to {productname-short}].
endif::[]
ifdef::cloud-service[]
* You are part of the administrator group for {productname-short} in OpenShift.
* The groups that you want to define as administrator and user groups for {productname-short} already exist in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::self-managed[]
* You have the `cluster-admin` role in {openshift-platform}.
* The groups that you want to define as administrator and user groups for {productname-short} already exist in {openshift-platform}.
endif::[]

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Settings* -> *User management*.
. Define your {productname-short} admin groups: Under *Data science administrator groups*, click the text box and select an OpenShift group. Repeat this process to define multiple admin groups.
. Define your {productname-short} user groups: Under *Data science user groups*, click the text box and select an OpenShift group. Repeat this process to define multiple user groups.
+
IMPORTANT: The `system:authenticated` setting allows all users authenticated in OpenShift to access {productname-short}.

. Click *Save changes*.

.Verification
* Administrator users can successfully log in to {productname-short} and perform administrative functions.
* Non-administrator users can successfully log in to {productname-short}. They can also access and use individual components, such as Jupyter.
