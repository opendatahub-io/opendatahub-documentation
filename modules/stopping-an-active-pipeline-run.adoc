= Stopping an active pipeline run

[role='_abstract']
If you no longer require an active pipeline run to continue executing in a pipeline experiment, you can stop the run before its defined end date.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
* There is a previously created project available that contains a pipeline server.
* You have imported a pipeline to an active pipeline server.
* An active pipeline run is currently executing.

.Procedure   
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Develop & train* -> *Experiments*.
. On the *Experiments* page, from the *Project* drop-down list, select the project that contains the pipeline experiment for the active run that you want to stop.
. From the list of pipeline experiments, click the pipeline experiment that contains the run that you want to stop. 
. On the *Runs* tab, click the action menu (*&#8942;*) beside the active run that you want to stop, and then click *Stop*.
+
There might be a short delay while the run stops.

.Verification
* The `Failed` status icon (image:images/pipeline-run-fail.png[The pipeline run failure icon]) is displayed in the *Status* column of the stopped run.
