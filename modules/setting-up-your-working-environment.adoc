= Setting up your working environment

You must set up your {productname-long} working environment so that you can use features to train models.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the {productname-short} data science project in which your cluster administrator has set up the feature store instance and loaded features in the online store.

* You have a `feature_store.yaml` file, shared by your cluster administrator. 

.Procedure

. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Data science projects*. 
. Click the name of the project in which your cluster administrator has set up the feature store instance.

ifdef::upstream[]
. In the data science project in which the cluster administrator set up Feature Store, create a workbench, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working-on-data-science-projects/#creating-a-project-workbench_projects[Creating a workbench].
endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
. In the data science project in which the cluster administrator set up Feature Store, create a workbench, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/using-project-workbenches_projects#creating-a-project-workbench_projects[Creating a workbench].
endif::[]

. To open the IDE, for example, JuypterLab, in a new window, click the open icon (image:images/open.png[The open icon]) next to the workbench.

. Add the `feature_store.yaml` file  to your notebook environment. For example,  upload a local file or clone a Git repo that contains the file, as described in .
 as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working-in-your-data-science-ide/#uploading-an-existing-notebook-file-to-jupyterlab-from-a-git-repository-using-cli_ide[Uploading an existing notebook file to JupyterLab from a Git repository by using the CLI].
endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
. Add the `feature_store.yaml` file  to your notebook environment. For example,  upload a local file or clone a Git repo that contains the file, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_in_your_data_science_ide/working_in_jupyterlab#uploading-an-existing-notebook-file-to-jupyterlab-from-a-git-repository-using-cli_ide[Uploading an existing notebook file to JupyterLab from a Git repository by using the CLI].
endif::[]

. Open a new Python notebook.

. In a cell, run the following command to install the `feast` CLI: 
+
----
! pip install feast 
----

.Verification

. Run the following command to list the available features:
+
----
! feast features list
----
+
The output should show a list of features, Feature View and data type similar to the following:
+
----
Feature	Feature     View                    Data Type
credit_card_due	    credit_history			Int64
mortgage_due	    credit_history			Int64
student_loan_due	credit_history			Int64
vehicle_loan_due	credit_history			Int64
city			    zipcode_features		String
state			    zipcode_features		String
location_type		zipcode_features		String
----

. Optionally, run the following commands to list the registered feast projects, feature views, and entities.
+
----
! feast projects list

! feast feature-views list

! feast entities list
