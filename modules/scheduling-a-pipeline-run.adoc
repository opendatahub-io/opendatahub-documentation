= Scheduling a pipeline run

[role='_abstract']
You can instantiate a single execution of a pipeline by scheduling a pipeline run. In {productname-short}, you can schedule runs to occur at specific times or execute them immediately after creation.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the OpenShift Pipelines operator.
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* You have previously created a data science project that is available and contains a configured pipeline server.
* You have imported a pipeline to an active pipeline server.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Data Science Pipelines* -> *Pipelines*.
+
The *Pipelines* page opens.
. From the *Project* list, select the project that you want to create a run for.
. Click the action menu (*&#8942;*) beside the relevant pipeline and click *Create run*.
+
The *Create run* page opens.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the run.
. In the *Description* field, enter a description for the run.
. From the *Pipeline* list, select the pipeline that you want to create a run for. Alternatively, to create a new pipeline, click *Create new pipeline* and complete the relevant fields in the *Import pipeline* dialog.
. From the *Pipeline version* list, select the pipeline version to create a run for. Alternatively, to upload a new version, click *Upload new version* and complete the relevant fields in the *Upload new version* dialog.
. Configure the run type by performing one of the following sets of actions:
* Select *Run once immediately after creation* to specify the run executes once, and immediately after its creation.
* Select *Schedule recurring run* to schedule the run to recur.
... Configure the run's trigger type.
.... Select *Periodic* to specify an execution frequency. Enter a numerical value and select an execution frequency from the list.
.... Select *Cron* to specify the execution schedule in `cron` format. This creates a cron job to execute the run. Click the *Copy* button (image:images/osd-copy.png[]) to copy the cron job schedule to the clipboard. The field furthest to the left represents seconds. For more information about scheduling tasks using the supported `cron` format, see link:https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron#hdr-CRON_Expression_Format[Cron Expression Format].
... Configure the run's duration.
.... Select the *Start date* check box to specify a start date for the run. Select the run's start date using the *Calendar* and the start time from the list of times.
.... Select the *End date* check box to specify an end date for the run. Select the run's end date using the *Calendar* and the end time from the list of times.
. Configure the input parameters for the run by selecting the parameters from the list.
. Click *Create*.

.Verification
* The pipeline run that you created is shown in the *Scheduled* tab on the *Runs* page.
