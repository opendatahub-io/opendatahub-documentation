= Scheduling a pipeline run

[role='_abstract']
To repeatedly run a pipeline, you can create a scheduled pipeline run.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
* You have previously created a project that is available and contains a configured pipeline server.
* You have imported a pipeline to an active pipeline server.

.Procedure
. To go to the *Schedules* tab for a run, perform one of the following sets of actions:
+
--
* *To select a run from an experiment*
.. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Experiments* -> *Experiments and runs*.
.. On the *Experiments* page, from the *Project* drop-down list, select the project that contains the pipeline experiment for the run that you want to schedule.
.. From the list of pipeline experiments, click the experiment that contains the run that you want to schedule. 
.. Click the *Schedules* tab.
* *To select any run* 
.. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Develop & train* -> *Pipelines* -> *Runs*.
.. On the *Runs* page, from the *Project* drop-down list, select the project that contains the run that you want to schedule.
.. Click the *Schedules* tab.
--
. Click *Create schedule*. 
. On the *Create schedule* page, configure the run that you are scheduling:
.. From the *Experiment* list, select the pipeline experiment that you want to contain the scheduled run. Alternatively, to create a new pipeline experiment, click *Create new experiment*, and then complete the relevant fields in the *Create experiment* dialog.
.. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the run.
.. In the *Description* field, enter a description for the run.
.. From the *Trigger type* list, select one of the following options:
* Select *Periodic* to specify an execution frequency. In the *Run every* field, enter a number and select an execution frequency from the list.
* Select *Cron* to specify the execution schedule in `cron` format in the *Cron string* field. This creates a cron job to execute the run. Click the *Copy* button (image:images/osd-copy.png[]) to copy the cron job schedule to the clipboard. The field furthest to the left represents seconds. For more information about scheduling tasks using the supported `cron` format, see link:https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron#hdr-CRON_Expression_Format[Cron Expression Format].
.. In the *Maximum concurrent runs* field, specify the number of runs that can execute concurrently, from a range of one to ten.  
.. For *Start date*, specify a start date for the run. Select a start date using the calendar, and the start time from the list of times.
.. For *End date*, specify an end date for the run. Select an end date using the calendar, and the end time from the list of times.
.. For *Catch up*, enable or disable catch up runs. You can use catch up runs to ensure your pipeline runs do not permanently fall behind schedule when they are paused. For example, if you re-enable a paused recurring run, the run scheduler backfills each missed run interval.
.. From the *Pipeline* list, select the pipeline that you want to create a run for. Alternatively, to create a new pipeline, click *Create new pipeline*, and then complete the relevant fields in the *Import pipeline* dialog.
.. For *Pipeline version*, select one of the following options:
* Select *Always use the latest pipeline version* so that each recurring run automatically uses the most recent pipeline version.
* Select *Use fixed version*, then select a specific pipeline version for all recurring runs. Alternatively, to upload a new version, click *Upload new version*, and then complete the relevant fields in the *Upload new version* dialog.
.. Configure the input parameters for the run by selecting the parameters from the list.
.. Click *Create schedule*.

.Verification
* The pipeline run that you scheduled is displayed on the *Schedules* tab on the *Runs* page for the pipeline experiment.
