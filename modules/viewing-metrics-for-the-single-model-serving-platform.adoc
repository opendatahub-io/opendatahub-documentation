= Viewing serving runtime metrics for the single-model serving platform

[role="_abstract"]
When a cluster administrator has configured monitoring for the single-model serving platform, non-admin users can use the OpenShift web console to view available serving runtime metrics for the KServe component. 

.Prerequisites
ifdef::self-managed[]
* A cluster administrator has configured monitoring for the single-model serving platform.
* You have been link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp-latest-version}/monitoring/enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects.html#granting-users-permission-to-monitor-user-defined-projects_enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects[assigned^] the `monitoring-rules-view` role.
* You are familiar with how to link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/building_applications/odc-monitoring-project-and-application-metrics-using-developer-perspective#odc-monitoring-your-project-metrics_monitoring-project-and-application-metrics-using-developer-perspective[monitor project metrics^] in the {openshift-platform} web console.
endif::[]
ifdef::cloud-service[]
* You have access to the OpenShift cluster as a developer or as a user with view permissions for the project that you are viewing metrics for.
* You are familiar with querying metrics in user-defined projects. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/dedicated/monitoring/managing-metrics.html#querying-metrics-for-user-defined-projects-as-a-developer_managing-metrics[Querying metrics for user-defined projects as a developer^] (Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated) or link:https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/monitoring/managing-metrics.html#querying-metrics-for-user-defined-projects-as-a-developer_managing-metrics[Querying metrics for user-defined projects as a developer^] (Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS).
