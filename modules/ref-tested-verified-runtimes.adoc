= Tested and verified model-serving runtimes

[role='_abstract']

Tested and verified runtimes are community versions of model-serving runtimes that have been tested and verified against specific versions of {productname-short}. 

{org-name} tests the current version of a tested and verified runtime each time there is a new version of {productname-short}. If a new version of a tested and verified runtime is released in the middle of an {productname-short} release cycle, it will be tested and verified in an upcoming release.

ifndef::upstream[]
A list of the tested and verified runtimes and compatible versions is available in the link:{rhoaidocshome}html-single/release_notes[{productname-short} release notes].

[NOTE]
--
Tested and verified runtimes are not directly supported by {org-name}. You are responsible for ensuring that you are licensed to use any tested and verified runtimes that you add, and for correctly configuring and maintaining them.
