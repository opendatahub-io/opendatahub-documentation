= Tested and verified model-serving runtimes

[role='_abstract']

Tested and verified runtimes are community versions of model-serving runtimes that have been tested and verified against specific versions of {productname-short}. 

{org-name} tests the current version of a tested and verified runtime each time there is a new version of {productname-short}. If a new version of a tested and verified runtime is released in the middle of an {productname-short} release cycle, it will be tested and verified in an upcoming release.

See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhoai-supported-configs[Supported configurations] for a list of tested and verified runtimes in {productname-short}.

[NOTE]
--
Tested and verified runtimes are not directly supported by {org-name}. You are responsible for ensuring that you are licensed to use any tested and verified runtimes that you add, and for correctly configuring and maintaining them.
