[role='_abstract']
You can deploy a version of a registered model directly from a model registry.

.Prerequisites
* An available model registry exists in your deployment.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Model Registry*.
. From the *Model registry* dropdown menu, select the model registry from which you want to deploy a model version.
. In the *Model name* column, click the name of the model that contains the version that you want to deploy.
+
The details page for the model version opens.
. Click the action menu (*&#8942;*) beside the model version that you want to deploy.
. Click *Deploy*.
. In the *Deploy model* dialog, configure properties for deploying the model.
.. From the *Project* drop-down list, select a target project.
.. Click *Deploy*.
. Configure the following properties for deploying your model:
.. From the *Project* drop-down list, select a project in which to deploy your model.
.. Optional: In the *Model deployment name* field, enter a name for the model deployment. 
+
Each deployment is named in the following format by default:
+
`<model name> <model version name> <deployment creation timestamp>`
+
This will be the name of the inference service that is created when the model is deployed.
