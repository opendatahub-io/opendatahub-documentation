* An available model registry exists in your deployment.
* A data science project with a configured model serving platform exists in your deployment

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Model Registry*.
. From the *Model registry* dropdown menu, select the model registry from which you want to deploy a model version.
. In the *Model name* column, click the name of the model that contains the version that you want to deploy.

. Configure the following properties for deploying your model:
.. From the *Project* drop-down list, select a project in which to deploy your model.
.. Optional: In the *Model deployment name* field, enter a name for the model deployment. 
+
Each deployment is named in the following format by default:
+
`<model name> <model version name> <deployment creation timestamp>`
+
This will be the name of the inference service that is created when the model is deployed.
.. From the *Serving runtime* drop-down list, select a serving runtime.
.. From the *Model framework (name - version)* drop-down list, select a model framework.
.. In the *Number of model server replicas to deploy* field, specify a value.

... In the *Service account name* field, enter a service account name for which the token will be generated. The generated token is created and displayed in the *Token secret* field when the model server is configured. 								
... To add an additional service account, click *Add a service account* and enter another service account name. 
.. In the *Source model location* section, configure the location of the source model:
* *To use an existing data connection*:
... Select *Existing data connection*.
... From the *Name* list, select a data connection that you previously defined.
... In the *Path* field, enter the folder path that contains the model in your specified data source.
* *To use a new data connection*:
... To define a new data connection that your model can access, select *New data connection*.
... In the *Name* field, enter a unique name for the data connection.
... In the *Access key* field, enter the access key ID for your S3-compatible object storage provider.
... In the *Secret key* field, enter the secret access key for the S3-compatible object storage account that you specified.
... In the *Endpoint* field, enter the endpoint of your S3-compatible object storage bucket.
... In the *Region* field, enter the default region of your S3-compatible object storage account.
... In the *Bucket* field, enter the name of your S3-compatible object storage bucket.
