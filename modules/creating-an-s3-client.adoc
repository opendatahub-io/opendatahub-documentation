= Creating an S3 client

[role='_abstract']
To interact with data stored in an S3-compatible object store from a workbench, you must create a local client to handle requests to the AWS S3 service by using an AWS SDK such as Boto3.

Boto3 is an AWS SDK for Python that provides an API for creating and managing AWS services, such as AWS S3 or S3-compatible object storage. 

After you have configured a Boto3 client for the S3 service from a workbench, you can connect and work with data in your S3-compatible object store.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to an S3-compatible object store.
* You have stored files in a bucket on your object store.
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.

* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* You have created a data science project.
* You have added a workbench to the project using a Jupyter notebook image.
* You have configured a data connection for your workbench based on the credentials of your S3-compatible storage account. 

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Data Science Projects*.
. Click the name of the project that contains the workbench.
. Click the *Workbenches* tab.
. If the status of the workbench is *Running*, skip to the next step. 
+
If the status of the workbench is *Stopped*, in the *Status* column for the workbench, click *Start*. 
+
The *Status* column changes from *Stopped* to *Starting* when the workbench server is starting, and then to *Running* when the workbench has successfully started.
.  Click the *Open* link next to the workbench.
+ 
Your Jupyter environment window opens.
. On the toolbar, click the *Git Clone* icon and then select *Clone a Repository*.
. In the *Clone a repo* dialog, enter the following URL `https://github.com/opendatahub-io/odh-doc-examples.git` and then click *Clone*.
. In the file browser, select the newly-created `odh-doc-examples` folder.
. Double-click the newly created `storage` folder.
+ 
You see a Jupyter notebook named `s3client_examples.ipynb`.
. Double-click the `s3client_examples.ipynb` file to launch the notebook.
+
The notebook opens. You see code examples for the following tasks: 
+
** Installing Boto3 and required Boto3 libraries
** Creating an S3 client session 
** Creating an S3 client connection
** Listing files
** Creating a bucket
** Uploading a file to a bucket
** Downloading a file from a bucket
** Copying files between buckets
** Deleting an object from a bucket
** Deleting a bucket
. In the notebook, locate the following instructions to install Boto3 and its required libraries, and run the code cell:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
#Upgrade pip to the latest version
!pip3 install --upgrade pip

#Install Boto3
!pip3 install boto3
 
#Install Boto3 libraries
import os 
import boto3 
from botocore.client import Config
from boto3 import session

#Check Boto3 version
!pip3 show boto3
----
+
The instructions in the code cell update the Python Package Manager (pip) to the latest version, install Boto3 and its required libraries, and display the version of Boto3 installed. 
. Locate the following instructions to create an S3 client and session. Run the code cell. 
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
#Creating an S3 client
#Define credentials
key_id = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID') 
secret_key = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY') 
endpoint = os.environ.get('AWS_S3_ENDPOINT')
region = os.environ.get('AWS_DEFAULT_REGION')

#Define client session
session = Boto3.session.Session(aws_access_key_id=key_id, 
aws_secret_access_key=secret_key) 

#Define client connection
s3_client = Boto3.client('s3', aws_access_key_id=key_id, 
aws_secret_access_key=secret_key,aws_session_token=None,
    config=Boto3.session.Config(signature_version='s3v4'),
                        endpoint_url=endpoint,
                        region_name=region)
----
+
The instructions in the code cell configure an S3 client and establish a session to your S3-compatible object store.

.Verification
* To use the S3 client to connect to your object store and list the available buckets, locate the following instructions to list buckets and run the code cell:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
s3_client.list_buckets()
----
+
A successful response includes a `HTTPStatusCode` of `200` and a list of buckets similar to the following output:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
'HTTPStatusCode': 200,
'Buckets': [{'Name': 'aqs086-image-registry',
'CreationDate': datetime.datetime(2024, 1, 16, 20, 21, 36, 244000, tzinfo=tzlocal  ())}]
