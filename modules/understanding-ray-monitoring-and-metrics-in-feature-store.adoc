== Understanding Ray monitoring and metrics in Feature Store
You can check cluster resources and monitor job progress when working with the Ray compute engine.
[role="_abstract"]
See the following Python example for how to extract monitoring and metrics data:
[source,python]
----
import ray

# Check cluster resources
resources = ray.cluster_resources()
print(f"Available CPUs: {resources.get('CPU', 0)}")
print(f"Available memory: {resources.get('memory', 0) / 1e9:.2f} GB")

# Monitor job progress
job = store.get_historical_features(...)
# Ray compute engine provides built-in progress tracking
