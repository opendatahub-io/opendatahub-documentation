= Using LLM-as-a-Judge metrics with LM-Eval

[role='_abstract']

You can use a large language model (LLM) to assess the quality of outputs from another LLM, known as LLM-as-a-Judge (LLMaaJ).

You can use LLMaaJ to:

* Assess work with no clearly correct answer, such as creative writing.
* Judge quality characteristics such as helpfulness, safety, and depth.
* Augment traditional quantitative measures that are used to evaluate a model's performance (for example, `ROUGE` metrics).
* Test specific quality aspects of your model output.

Follow the custom quality assessment example below to learn more about using your own metrics criteria with LM-Eval to evaluate model responses.

This example uses link:https://www.unitxt.ai[Unitxt] to define custom metrics and to see how the model (link:https://www.huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-small[flan-t5-small]) answers questions from MT-Bench, a standard benchmark. Custom evaluation criteria and instructions from the link:https://www.huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2[Mistral-7B] model are used to rate the answers from 1-10, based on helpfulness, accuracy, and detail.


.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
* You have installed the {openshift-cli} as described in the appropriate documentation for your cluster:

* Your cluster administrator has installed {productname-short} and enabled the TrustyAI service for the data science project where the models are deployed.

* You are familiar with how to use Unitxt.

* You have set the following parameters:

.Parameters
[cols="2,4"]
|===
| Parameter | Description

| Custom template
| Tells the judge to assign a score between 1 and 10 in a standardized format, based on specific criteria.


| `processors.extract_mt_bench_rating_judgment`
| Pulls the numerical rating from the judge's response.

| `formats.models.mistral.instruction`
| Formats the prompts for the Mistral model.

| Custom LLM-as-judge metric
| Uses Mistral-7B with your custom instructions.
|===

.Procedure
. In a terminal window, if you are not already logged in to your OpenShift cluster as a cluster administrator, log in to the {openshift-cli} as shown in the following example:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc login __<openshift_cluster_url>__ -u __<admin_username>__ -p __<password>__
----
. Update the TrustyAI configuration to allow online model access and code execution by applying the following instructions to the `pass:attributes[{dbd-config-default-namespace}]` namespace.
+
[source, bash, subs="attributes+"]
----
oc patch configmap trustyai-service-operator-config -n {dbd-config-default-namespace}  \
--type merge -p '{"metadata": {"annotations": {"opendatahub.io/managed": "false"}}}'

oc patch configmap trustyai-service-operator-config -n {dbd-config-default-namespace} \
--type merge -p '{"data":{"lmes-allow-online":"true","lmes-allow-code-execution":"true"}}'
----
. Apply the following manifest by using the `oc apply -f -` command. The YAML content defines a custom evaluation job (`LMEvalJob`), the namespace, and the location of the model you want to evaluate.
The YAML contains the following instructions:
.. Which model to evaluate.
.. What data to use.
.. How to format inputs and outputs.
.. Which judge model to use.
.. How to extract and log results.
+
[NOTE]
--
You can also put the YAML manifest into a file using a text editor and then apply it by using the `oc apply -f file.yaml` command.

A processor extracts the numeric rating from the judge's natural language response. The final result is available as part of the LMEval Job Custom Resource (CR).
