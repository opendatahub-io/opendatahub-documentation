= Overview of vector databases

[role="_abstract"]
Vector databases are a core component of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) in {productname-short}. They store and index vector embeddings that represent the semantic meaning of text or other data. When integrated with Llama Stack, vector databases enable applications to combine large language models (LLMs) with relevant, domain-specific knowledge.

Vector databases provide the following capabilities:

* Store vector embeddings generated by embedding models
* Perform efficient similarity search across large embedding collections
* Supply relevant contextual data to LLMs during inference

In {productname-short}, vector databases are configured and consumed through the Llama Stack Operator and the OpenAI-compatible Vector Stores API.

== Supported vector database options

{productname-short} supports the following vector database configurations:

* *Inline Milvus Lite*  
  Inline Milvus runs embedded within the Llama Stack Distribution (LSD) pod and is suitable for development and evaluation use cases. Vector indexing and search run in-process, while vector metadata persistence uses the default PostgreSQL-backed metadata store configured for Llama Stack. Inline Milvus is limited to single-instance operation.

* *Inline FAISS*  
  Inline FAISS provides a lightweight, in-process vector store based on the FAISS library. FAISS handles vector indexing and similarity search within the Llama Stack server, while vector metadata persistence uses the default PostgreSQL-backed metadata store. Inline FAISS is intended for testing, experimentation, and non-distributed RAG workloads.

* *Remote Milvus*  
  Remote Milvus runs as a standalone vector database service, either within the cluster or as an external managed deployment. It provides scalable, durable, and production-ready vector storage. Remote Milvus requires an associated etcd service for coordination and metadata management.

* *Remote PostgreSQL with pgvector*  
  PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension can be used as a remote vector database provider. In this configuration, vector embeddings and similarity search are handled directly within PostgreSQL, providing durable storage, concurrency support, and integration with existing PostgreSQL operational tooling. This option is suitable for production-grade RAG workloads that require persistence and centralized management.

== Choosing a vector database

Consider the following guidance when selecting a vector database for your RAG workloads:

* Use **inline Milvus Lite** for rapid experimentation or development workflows that run within a single Llama Stack instance.
* Use **inline FAISS** for lightweight, in-process vector search when external services are not required.
* Use **remote Milvus** for large-scale or high-availability RAG deployments that require distributed vector storage.
* Use **remote PostgreSQL with pgvector** when you want durable vector storage that integrates with existing PostgreSQL-based platforms and operational practices.
