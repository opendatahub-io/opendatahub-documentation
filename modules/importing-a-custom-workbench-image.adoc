= Importing a custom workbench image

[role='_abstract']
ifdef::upstream[]
You can import custom workbench images that cater to your {productname-short} project's specific requirements. From the *Notebook images* page, you can enable or disable a previously imported workbench image and create an accelerator profile as a recommended accelerator for existing notebook images.
endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
In addition to workbench images provided and supported by {org-name} and independent software vendors (ISVs), you can import custom workbench images that cater to your project's specific requirements.
endif::[]

You must import it so that your {productname-short} users (data scientists) can access it when they create a project workbench.

ifndef::upstream[]
{org-name} supports adding custom workbench images to your deployment of {productname-short}, ensuring that they are available for selection when creating a workbench. However, {org-name} does not support the contents of your custom workbench image. That is, if your custom workbench image is available for selection during workbench creation, but does not create a usable workbench, {org-name} does not provide support to fix your custom workbench image.
endif::[]

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-short} as a user with {productname-short} administrator privileges. 
* Your custom image exists in an image registry that is accessible to {productname-short}.

ifdef::upstream[]
* The *Settings* -> *Notebook images* dashboard navigation menu option is enabled, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/managing-resources/#enabling-custom-images_custom-images[Creating a custom image from a default {productname-short} image].
endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
* The *Settings* -> *Notebook images* dashboard navigation menu option is enabled, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/managing_resources/creating-custom-workbench-images#enabling-custom-images_custom-images[Enabling custom workbench images in {productname-short}].
endif::[]

* If you want to associate an accelerator with the custom image that you want to import, you know the accelerator's identifier - the unique string that identifies the hardware accelerator.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Settings* -> *Notebook images*.
+
The *Notebook images* page appears. Previously imported images are displayed. To enable or disable a previously imported image, on the row containing the relevant image, click the toggle in the *Enable* column. 

. Optional: If you want to associate an accelerator and you have not already created an accelerator profile, click  *Create profile* on the row containing the image and complete the relevant fields. If the image does not contain an accelerator identifier, you must manually configure one before creating an associated accelerator profile.  

. Click *Import new image*. Alternatively, if no previously imported images were found, click *Import image*.
+
The *Import Notebook images* dialog appears.
. In the *Image location* field, enter the URL of the repository containing the image. For example: `quay.io/my-repo/my-image:tag`, `quay.io/my-repo/my-image@sha256:xxxxxxxxxxxxx`, or
`docker.io/my-repo/my-image:tag`.

. In the *Name* field, enter an appropriate name for the image.
. Optional: In the *Description* field, enter a description for the image.
. Optional: From the *Accelerator identifier* list, select an identifier to set its accelerator as recommended with the image. If the image contains only one accelerator identifier, the identifier name displays by default.
. Optional: Add software to the image. After the import has completed, the software is added to the image's meta-data and displayed on the Jupyter server creation page.
.. Click the *Software* tab.
.. Click the *Add software* button.
.. Click *Edit* (image:images/rhoai-edit-icon.png[The Edit icon]).
.. Enter the *Software* name.
.. Enter the software *Version*.
.. Click *Confirm* (image:images/rhoai-confirm-icon.png[The Confirm icon]) to confirm your entry.
.. To add additional software, click *Add software*, complete the relevant fields, and confirm your entry.
. Optional: Add packages to the notebook images. After the import has completed, the packages are added to the image's meta-data and displayed on the Jupyter server creation page.
.. Click the *Packages* tab.
.. Click the  *Add package* button.
.. Click *Edit* (image:images/rhoai-edit-icon.png[The Edit icon]).
.. Enter the *Package* name. For example, if you want to include data science pipeline V2 automatically, as a runtime configuration, type `odh-elyra`.
.. Enter the package *Version*. For example, type `3.16.7`.
.. Click *Confirm* (image:images/rhoai-confirm-icon.png[The Confirm icon]) to confirm your entry.
.. To add an additional package, click *Add package*, complete the relevant fields, and confirm your entry.
. Click *Import*.

.Verification
* The image that you imported is displayed in the table on the *Notebook images* page.
* Your custom image is available for selection when a user creates a workbench.
