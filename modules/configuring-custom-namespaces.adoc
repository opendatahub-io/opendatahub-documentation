= Configuring custom namespaces

[role='_abstract']
By default, {productname-short} uses predefined namespaces, but you can define a custom namespace for the operator and `DSCI.applicationNamespace` as needed. Namespaces created by {productname-short} typically include `openshift` or `redhat` in their name. Do not rename these system namespaces because they are required for {productname-short} to function properly.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to a {productname-short} cluster with cluster administrator privileges.
* You have downloaded and installed the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI). See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI^].

.Procedure
. In a terminal window, if you are not already logged in to your OpenShift cluster as a cluster administrator, log in to the OpenShift CLI as shown in the following example:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
oc login __<openshift_cluster_url>__ -u __<admin_username>__ -p __<password>__
----
. Enter the following command to create the custom namespace:
+
[source]
----
oc create namespace <custom_namespace>
----
. If you are creating a namespace for a `DSCI.applicationNamespace`, enter the following command to add the correct label:
+
[source]
----
oc label namespace <application_namespace> opendatahub.io/application-namespace=true
----
