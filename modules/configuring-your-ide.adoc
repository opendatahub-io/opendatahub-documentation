= Configuring your IDE

[role='_abstract']
You can configure some notebook workbenches to get the most out of your data science work.

== Configuring your code-server workbench
You can use extensions to streamline your workflow, add new languages, themes, debuggers, and connect to additional services.

For more information on code-server, see link:https://github.com/coder/code-server[code-server in GitHub].

Technology Preview features are not supported with Red{nbsp}Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete.
Red{nbsp}Hat does not recommend using them in production.
These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

=== Installing extensions with code-server

.Prerequisites

* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you use specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you use specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* You have created a data science project that has a code-server workbench.

.Procedure

. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Data Science Projects*.
+
The *Data science projects* page opens.
. Click the name of the project containing the code-server workbench you want to start.
+
The *Details* page for the project opens.
. Click the toggle in the *Status* column for the relevant workbench to start a workbench that is not running.
+
The status of the workbench that you started changes from *Stopped* to *Running*. 
. After the workbench has started, click *Open* to open the workbench notebook.
. In the Activity Bar, click the Extensions icon. (image:images/codeserver-extensions-icon.png[The Extensions icon])
. Search for the name of the extension you want to install. 
. Click *Install* to add the extension to your code-server environment.
+ 
The extension you installed appears in the *Browser - Installed* list on the *Extensions* panel.

==== Extensions

See link:https://open-vsx.org/[Open VSX Registry] for available third-party extensions that you can consider installing.

== Building the RStudio Server notebook images

To use the *RStudio Server* and *CUDA - RStudio Server* notebook images, you must first build them by creating a secret and triggering the BuildConfig, and then enable them in the {productname-short} UI by editing the `rstudio-rhel9` and `cuda-rstudio-rhel9` imagestreams.

.Prerequisites

* Before starting the RStudio Server build process, you have at least 1 CPU and 2Gi memory available for `rstudio-server-rhel9`, and 1.5 CPUs and 8Gi memory available for `cuda-rstudio-server-rhel9` on your cluster.
* You are logged in to your OpenShift cluster.
* You have the `cluster-admin` role in {openshift-platform}, to the namespace `rhoai-applications`, or with cluster-wide role binding.
* You have an active Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) subscription.

.Procedure

. Create a secret with subscription manager credentials. These are usually your Red Hat Customer Portal username and password.
+
Note: The secret must be named `rhel-subscription-secret`, and the keys `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` within it must be in capital letters. 
+
----
oc create secret generic rhel-subscription-secret --from-literal=USERNAME=<username> --from-literal=PASSWORD=<password> -n redhat-ods-applications
----
. Start the build:
.. To start the lightweight RStudio Server build: 
----
oc start-build rstudio-server-rhel9 -n redhat-ods-applications --follow
----
.. To start the CUDA-enabled RStudio Server build, trigger the `cuda-rhel9` BuildConfig: 
----
oc start-build cuda-rhel9 -n redhat-ods-applications --follow
----
+
The cuda-rhel9 build is a prerequisite for cuda-rstudio-rhel9. The cuda-rstudio-rhel9 build starts automatically.
. Confirm that the build process has completed successfully using the following command. Successful builds appear as `Complete`.
+
----
oc get builds -n redhat-ods-applications
----

.Verification

* You can see *RStudio Server* and *CUDA - RStudio Server* images on the *Applications* -> *Enabled* menu in the {productname-long} dashboard.
* You can see *R Studio Server * or *CUDA - RStudio Server* in the *Data Science Projects* -> *Workbenches* -> *Create workbench* -> *Notebook image* -> *Image selection* dropdown list.
