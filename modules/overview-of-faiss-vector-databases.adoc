= Overview of FAISS vector databases

The FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) library is an open source framework for high-performance vector search and clustering. It is optimized for dense numerical embeddings and supports both CPU and GPU execution. In {productname-short}, FAISS is supported as an *inline vector store provider* for Llama Stack, enabling fast, in-process similarity search without requiring a separate vector database service.

When you enable inline FAISS in a `LlamaStackDistribution`, Llama Stack uses FAISS as an embedded vector index that runs inside the Llama Stack server container. This configuration is designed for lightweight development, experimentation, and single-node retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows.

Inline FAISS provides the following capabilities in {productname-short}:

* In-process similarity search using FAISS indexes.
* Low-latency embedding ingestion and query operations.
* Simple deployment with no external vector database service.
* Compatibility with OpenAI-compatible Vector Stores API endpoints.

In {productname-short} 3.2, inline FAISS relies on the Llama Stack metadata and persistence backend for managing vector store state. PostgreSQL is the default and recommended backend for production-grade deployments, even when FAISS is used as the inline vector index.

SQLite can be explicitly configured for local or on-the-fly development scenarios, but it is not recommended for production use.

Inline FAISS is suitable for the following use cases:

* Rapid prototyping of RAG workflows.
* Development or testing environments.
* Disconnected or single-node deployments where external vector databases are not required.

[NOTE]
====
Inline FAISS does not provide distributed storage, replication, or high availability. For production-grade RAG workloads that require durability, scalability, or multi-node access, use a remote vector database such as Milvus or PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension.
