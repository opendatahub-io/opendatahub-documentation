= Creating a custom image from a default {productname-short} image

After {productname-long} is installed on a cluster, you can find the default workbench images in the OpenShift console, under *Builds* -> *ImageStreams* for the `redhat-ods-applications` project.

You can create a custom image by adding OS packages or applications to a default {productname-short} image.

.Prerequisites

* You know which default image you want to use as the base for your custom image. 
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you want to build a custom Elyra image, you must customize an existing {productname-short} Elyra image.
====

+
See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhoai-supported-configs[Supported Configurations] for a list of the {productname-short} default workbench images and their preinstalled packages.
endif::[]

* You have `cluster-admin` access to the OpenShift console for the cluster where {productname-short} is installed. 


.Procedure

. Obtain the location of the default image that you want to use as the base for your custom image.
.. In the OpenShift console, select *Builds* -> *ImageStreams*.
.. Select the *redhat-ods-applications* project.
.. From the list of installed imagestreams, click the name of the image that you want to use as the base for your custom image. For example, click *pytorch*.
.. On the ImageStream details page, click *YAML*.
.. In the `spec:tags` section, find the tag for the version of the image that you want to use. 
+
The location of the original image is shown in the tag's `from:name` section, for example: 
+
`name: 'quay.io/modh/odh-pytorch-notebook@sha256:b68e0192abf7d…'`

.. Copy this location for use in your custom image.

. Create a standard Containerfile or Dockerfile.

. For the `FROM` instruction, specify the base image location that you copied in Step 1, for example:
+
`FROM quay.io/modh/odh-pytorch-notebook@sha256:b68e0…`

. Optional: Install OS images:

.. Switch to `USER 0` (USER 0 is required to install OS packages).
.. Install the packages.
.. Switch back to `USER 1001`.
+
The following example creates a custom workbench image that adds Java to the default PyTorch image:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
 FROM quay.io/modh/odh-pytorch-notebook@sha256:b68e0…

 USER 0

 RUN INSTALL_PKGS="java-11-openjdk java-11-openjdk-devel" && \
    dnf install -y --setopt=tsflags=nodocs $INSTALL_PKGS && \
    dnf -y clean all --enablerepo='*'

 USER 1001
----

. Optional: Add Python packages:

.. Specify `USER 1001`.
.. Copy the `requirements.txt` file.
.. Install the packages.
+
The following example installs packages from the `requirements.txt` file in the default PyTorch image:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
 FROM quay.io/modh/odh-pytorch-notebook@sha256:b68e0…

 USER 1001

 COPY requirements.txt ./requirements.txt
 
 RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
----  

. Build the image file. For example, you can use `podman build` locally where the image file is located and then push the image to a registry that is accessible to {productname-short}:
+
----
$ podman build -t my-registry/my-custom-image:0.0.1 .
$ podman push my-registry/my-custom-image:0.0.1
----
+
Alternatively, you can leverage OpenShift's image build capabilities by using link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/builds_using_buildconfig/understanding-buildconfigs[BuildConfig].
