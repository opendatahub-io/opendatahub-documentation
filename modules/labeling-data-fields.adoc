[role='_abstract']
After you send model training data to TrustyAI, you might want to apply a set of name mappings to your inputs and outputs so that the field names are meaningful and easier to work with.

.Prerequisites

* Your OpenShift cluster administrator added you as a user to the {openshift-platform} cluster and has installed the TrustyAI service for the data science project that contains the deployed models.

ifndef::upstream[]
* You sent training data to TrustyAI as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/monitoring_data_science_models/setting-up-trustyai-for-your-project_monitor#sending-training-data-to-trustyai_monitor[Sending training data to TrustyAI].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* You sent training data to TrustyAI as described in link:{odhdocshome}/monitoring-data-science-models/#sending-training-data-to-trustyai_monitor[Sending training data to TrustyAI].
endif::[]

.Procedure

. Open a new terminal window.
. Follow these steps to log in to your {openshift-platform} cluster:
.. In the upper-right corner of the OpenShift web console, click your user name and select *Copy login command*. 
.. After you have logged in, click *Display token*.
.. Copy the *Log in with this token* command and paste it in the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI).

----
$ oc login --token=__<token>__ --server=__<openshift_cluster_url>__
----

. In the OpenShift CLI, get the route to the TrustyAI service: 
+
[source]
----
TRUSTY_ROUTE=https://$(oc get route/trustyai-service --template={{.spec.host}})
----

. To examine TrustyAI's model metadata, query the `/info` endpoint:
+
[source]
----
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $TRUSTY_ROUTE/info | jq ".[0].data"
----
+
This outputs a JSON file containing the following information for each model:

* The names, data types, and positions of input fields and output fields.
* The observed field values.
* The total number of input-output pairs observed.

. Use `POST /info/names` to apply name mappings to the fields, similar to the following example. 
+
Change the `model-name`, `original-name`, and `Prediction` values to those used in your model. Change the `New name` values to the labels that you want to use. 
+

----
curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X POST --location $TRUSTY_ROUTE/info/names \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"   \
  -d "{
    \"modelId\": \"model-name\",
    \"inputMapping\":
      {
        \"original-name-0\": \"New name 0\",
        \"original-name-1\": \"New name 1\",
        \"original-name-2\": \"New name 2\",
        \"original-name-3\": \"New name 3\",
      },
    \"outputMapping\": {
      \"predict-0\": \"Prediction 0\"
    }
  }"

.Verification

A "Feature and output name mapping successfully applied" message is displayed.
