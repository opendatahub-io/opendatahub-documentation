= Viewing the status of distributed workloads

[role='_abstract']

In {productname-short}, you can view the status of all distributed workloads in the selected project.
You can track the progress of the distributed workloads, and identify corrective action when necessary.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed {productname-long}.
* On the OpenShift cluster where {productname-short} is installed, user workload monitoring is enabled.
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* Your data science project contains distributed workloads.

.Procedure

. In the {productname-short} left navigation pane, click *Distributed Workloads Metrics*.

. From the *Project* list, select the project that contains the distributed workloads that you want to monitor.

. Click the *Distributed workload status* tab.

. Optional: From the *Refresh interval* list, select a value to specify how frequently the graphs on the metrics page are refreshed to show the latest data.
+
You can select one of these values: *15 seconds*, *30 seconds*, *1 minute*, *5 minutes*, *15 minutes*, *30 minutes*, *1 hour*, *2 hours*, or *1 day*.

. In the *Status overview* section, review a summary of the status of all distributed workloads in the selected project.
+
The status can be *Pending*, *Inadmissible*, *Admitted*, *Running*, *Evicted*, *Succeeded*, or *Failed*.

. Scroll down to view the *Distributed workloads* table, which lists all of the distributed workloads in the selected project.
The table provides the priority, status, creation date, and latest message for each distributed workload.
+
The latest message provides more information about the current status of the distributed workload.
Review the latest message to identify any corrective action needed.
For example, a distributed workload might be *Inadmissible* because the requested resources exceed the available resources.
In such cases, you can either reconfigure the distributed workload to reduce the requested resources, or reconfigure the cluster queue for the project to increase the resource quota.


.Verification

On the *Distributed workload status* tab, the graph provides a summarized view of the status of all distributed workloads in the selected project, and the table provides more details about the status of each distributed workload.
