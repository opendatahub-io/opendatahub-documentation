= Viewing project metrics for distributed workloads

[role='_abstract']

In {productname-short}, you can view the following project metrics for distributed workloads:

* *CPU* - The number of CPU cores that are currently being used by all distributed workloads in the selected project.
* *Memory* - The amount of memory in gibibytes (GiB) that is currently being used by all distributed workloads in the selected project.

You can use these metrics to monitor the resources used by the distributed workloads, and assess whether project resources are allocated correctly.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed {productname-long}.

* On the OpenShift cluster where {productname-short} is installed, user workload monitoring is enabled.

* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* Your data science project contains distributed workloads.

.Procedure

. In the {productname-short} left navigation pane, click *Distributed Workloads Metrics*.

. From the *Project* list, select the project that contains the distributed workloads that you want to monitor.

. Click the *Project metrics* tab.

. Optional: From the *Refresh interval* list, select a value to specify how frequently the graphs on the metrics page are refreshed to show the latest data.
+
You can select one of these values: *15 seconds*, *30 seconds*, *1 minute*, *5 minutes*, *15 minutes*, *30 minutes*, *1 hour*, *2 hours*, or *1 day*.

. In the *Requested resources* section, review the *CPU* and *Memory* graphs to identify the resources requested by distributed workloads as follows:
+
* Requested by the selected project
* Requested by all projects, including the selected project and projects that you cannot access
* Total shared quota for all projects, as provided by the cluster queue

+
For each resource type (*CPU* and *Memory*), subtract the *Requested by all projects* value from the *Total shared quota* value to calculate how much of that resource quota has not been requested and is available for all projects.

. Scroll down to the *Top resource-consuming distributed workloads* section to review the following graphs:
+
* Top 5 distributed workloads that are consuming the most CPU resources
* Top 5 distributed workloads that are consuming the most memory

+
You can also identify how much CPU or memory is used in each case.

. Scroll down to view the *Distributed workload resource metrics* table, which lists all of the distributed workloads in the selected project, and indicates the current resource usage and the status of each distributed workload.
+
In each table entry, progress bars indicate how much of the requested CPU and memory is currently being used by this distributed workload.
To see numeric values for the actual usage and requested usage for CPU (measured in cores) and memory (measured in GiB), hover the cursor over each progress bar.
Compare the actual usage with the requested usage to assess the distributed workload configuration.
If necessary, reconfigure the distributed workload to reduce or increase the requested resources.


.Verification

On the *Project metrics* tab, the graphs and table provide resource-usage data for the distributed workloads in the selected project.
