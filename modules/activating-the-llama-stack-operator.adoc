[id="activating-the-llama-stack-operator_{context}"]
= Activating the Llama Stack Operator

[role='_abstract']
You can activate the Llama Stack Operator on your {openshift-platform} cluster by setting its `managementState` to `Managed` in the {productname-short} Operator `DataScienceCluster` custom resource (CR). This setting enables Llama-based model serving without reinstalling or directly editing Operator subscriptions. You can edit the CR in the {openshift-platform} web console or by using the {openshift-cli}.

[NOTE]
====
As an alternative to following the steps in this procedure, you can activate the Llama Stack Operator from the {openshift-cli} by running the following command:

[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc patch datasciencecluster _<name>_ --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"components":{"llamastackoperator":{"managementState":"Managed"}}}}'
----

Replace _<name>_ with your `DataScienceCluster` name, for example, `default-dsc`.

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator privileges.
* You have installed the {openshift-cli} as described in the appropriate documentation for your cluster:

* You have installed the {productname-long} Operator on your cluster.
* You have a `DataScienceCluster` custom resource in your environment; the default is `default-dsc`.
* Your infrastructure supports GPU-enabled instance types, for example, `g4dn.xlarge` on AWS.
ifndef::upstream[]
* You have enabled GPU support in {productname-short}, including installing the Node Feature Discovery Operator and NVIDIA GPU Operator. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/specialized_hardware_and_driver_enablement/psap-node-feature-discovery-operator#installing-the-node-feature-discovery-operator_psap-node-feature-discovery-operator[Installing the Node Feature Discovery Operator^] and link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/managing_openshift_ai/enabling-accelerators#enabling-nvidia-gpus_managing-rhoai[Enabling NVIDIA GPUs^].

* You have enabled GPU support in {productname-short}, including installing the Node Feature Discovery and NVIDIA GPU Operators. For more information, see link:https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/openshift/latest/index.html[NVIDIA GPU Operator on {org-name} OpenShift Container Platform^] in the NVIDIA documentation.
endif::[]
* You have created a `NodeFeatureDiscovery` resource instance on your cluster, as described in link:https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/openshift/latest/install-nfd.html#Procedure[Installing the Node Feature Discovery Operator and creating a NodeFeatureDiscovery instance^] in the NVIDIA documentation.
* You have created a `ClusterPolicy` resource instance with default values on your cluster, as described in link:https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/openshift/latest/install-gpu-ocp.html#create-the-clusterpolicy-instance[Creating the ClusterPolicy instance^] in the NVIDIA documentation.

.Procedure
. Log in to the {openshift-platform} web console as a cluster administrator.
. In the *Administrator* perspective, click *Operators* → *Installed Operators*.
. Click the *{productname-long} Operator* to open its details.
. Click the *Data Science Cluster* tab.
. On the *DataScienceClusters* page, click the `default-dsc` object.
. Click the *YAML* tab.
+
An embedded YAML editor opens, displaying the configuration for the `DataScienceCluster` custom resource.
. In the YAML editor, locate the `spec.components` section. If the `llamastackoperator` field does not exist, add it. Then, set the `managementState` field to `Managed`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  components:
    llamastackoperator:
      managementState: Managed
----
. Click *Save* to apply your changes.

.Verification

After you activate the Llama Stack Operator, verify that it is running in your cluster:

. In the {openshift-platform} web console, click *Workloads* → *Pods*.
. From the *Project* list, select the *`pass:attributes[{dbd-config-default-namespace}]`* namespace.
. Confirm that a pod with the label `app.kubernetes.io/name=llama-stack-operator` is displayed and has a status of *Running*.
