= Activating the Llama Stack Operator

[role='_abstract']
You can activate the Llama Stack Operator on your {openshift-platform} cluster by setting its `managementState` to `Managed` in the {productname-short} Operator `DataScienceCluster` custom resource (CR). This setting enables Llama-based model serving without reinstalling or directly editing Operator subscriptions. You can edit the CR in the {openshift-platform} web console or by using the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI).

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator privileges.
ifdef::upstream,self-managed[]
* You installed the OpenShift command line interface (`oc`) as described in link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI^].
endif::[]
ifdef::cloud-service[]
* You installed the OpenShift command line interface (`oc`) as described in link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_dedicated/{osd-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI (OpenShift Dedicated)^] or link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/{rosa-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI (Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS)^].
endif::[]
* You have installed the {productname-long} Operator on your cluster.
* You have a `DataScienceCluster` custom resource in your environment; the default is `default-dsc`.
* Your infrastructure supports GPU-enabled instance types, for example, `g4dn.xlarge` on AWS.
ifndef::upstream[]
* You have enabled GPU support in {productname-short}, including installing the Node Feature Discovery Operator and NVIDIA GPU Operator. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/specialized_hardware_and_driver_enablement/psap-node-feature-discovery-operator#installing-the-node-feature-discovery-operator_psap-node-feature-discovery-operator[Installing the Node Feature Discovery Operator^] and link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/managing_openshift_ai/enabling_accelerators#enabling-nvidia-gpus_managing-rhoai[Enabling NVIDIA GPUs^].

ifdef::upstream[]
* You have enabled GPU support in {productname-short}, including installing the Node Feature Discovery and NVIDIA GPU Operators. For more information, see link:https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/openshift/latest/index.html[NVIDIA GPU Operator on {org-name} OpenShift Container Platform^] in the NVIDIA documentation.
endif::[]
* You have created a `NodeFeatureDiscovery` resource instance on your cluster, as described in link:https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/openshift/latest/install-nfd.html#Procedure[Installing the Node Feature Discovery Operator and creating a NodeFeatureDiscovery instance^] in the NVIDIA documentation.
* You have created a `ClusterPolicy` resource instance with default values on your cluster, as described in link:https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/openshift/latest/install-gpu-ocp.html#create-the-clusterpolicy-instance[Creating the ClusterPolicy instance^] in the NVIDIA documentation.

.Procedure
. Log in to the {openshift-platform} web console as a cluster administrator.
. In the *Administrator* perspective, click *Operators* → *Installed Operators*.
. Click the *{productname-long} Operator* to open its details.
. Click the *Data Science Cluster* tab.
. On the *DataScienceClusters* page, click the `default-dsc` object.
. Click the *YAML* tab.
+
An embedded YAML editor opens, displaying the configuration for the `DataScienceCluster` custom resource.
. In the YAML editor, locate the `spec.components` section. If the `llamastackoperator` field does not exist, add it. Then, set the `managementState` field to `Managed`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  components:
    llamastackoperator:
      managementState: Managed
----
. Click *Save* to apply your changes.
+
Alternatively, you can activate the Llama Stack Operator from the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI) by running the following command:
+
[source,subs="+macros"]
----
$ oc patch datasciencecluster _<name>_ --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"components":{"llamastackoperator":{"managementState":"Managed"}}}}'
----
+
Replace _<name>_ with your `DataScienceCluster` name, for example, `default-dsc`.

.Verification

. After a short time, verify that the Llama Stack Operator is running:
.. In the {openshift-platform} web console, go to *Workloads* → *Pods*.
.. From the *Project* list, select the *redhat-ods-applications* namespace.
.. Confirm that a pod with the label `app.kubernetes.io/name=llama-stack-operator` has started and has a status of *Running*.
.. In the `DataScienceCluster` CR, confirm that the `managementState` field is set to `Managed`.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you want to disable the Llama Stack Operator, set the `managementState` field to `Removed` in the same way. The Operator will then remove the Llama Stack component from the cluster.
