= Deleting a model server

[role='_abstract']
When you no longer need a model server to host models, you can remove it from your data science project.

NOTE: When you remove a model server, you also remove the models that are hosted on that model server. As a result, the models are no longer available to applications.

.Prerequisites
* You have created a data science project and an associated model server.
* You have notified the users of the applications that access the models that the models will no longer be available.
