= Deleting a model server

[role='_abstract']
When you no longer need a model server to host models, you can remove it from your data science project.

NOTE: When you remove a model server, you also remove the models that are hosted on that model server. As a result, the models are no longer available to applications.

.Prerequisites
* You have created a data science project and an associated model server.
* You have notified the users of the applications that access the models that the models will no longer be available.


.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Data science projects*.
+
The *Data science projects* page opens.
. Click the name of the project from which you want to delete the model server.
+
A project details page opens.
. Click the *Deployments* tab.
. Click the action menu (*&#8942;*) beside the project whose model server you want to delete and then click *Delete model server*.
+
The *Delete model server* dialog opens.
. Enter the name of the model server in the text field to confirm that you intend to delete it.
. Click *Delete model server*.

.Verification
* The model server that you deleted is no longer displayed on the *Deployments* tab for the project.
