== Understanding Ray mode detection precedence in Feature Store 

[role="_abstract"]
You can easily manage mode detection precedence since the Ray compute engine automatically detects the execution mode:

* Environment Variables (→) KubeRay mode (if `FEAST_RAY_USE_KUBERAY=true`)
* Config `kuberay_conf` (→) KubeRay mode
* Config `ray_address` (→) Remote mode
* Default (→) Local mode

NOTE: It is recommended that you use KubeRay mode with {org-name}.

NOTE: For Ray usage examples of, see Ray compute engine usage examples.
