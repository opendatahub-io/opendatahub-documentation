.. Click the `OdhDashboardConfig` custom resource (CR) to open the resource details page.
.. Select the `redhat-ods-applications` project from the *Project* list.
.. Click the *Instances* tab.
.. Click the `odh-dashboard-config` instance to open the details page.
.. Click the *YAML* tab. 
. In the `spec:notebookController` section, set the value of `enabled` to `false` to hide the *Start basic workbench* tile from the list of Enabled applications.
. Click *Save* to apply your changes and then click *Reload* to make sure that your changes are synced to the cluster.
