= Benchmarking embedding models with BEIR datasets and Llama Stack

[role='_abstract']
This procedure explains how to set up, run, and verify embedding model benchmarks by using the Llama Stack framework. Embedding models are neural networks that convert text or other data into dense numerical vectors called embeddings, which capture semantic meaning. In retrieval augmented generation systems, embeddings enable semantic search so that the system retrieves the documents most relevant to a query.

Selecting an embedding model depends on several factors, such as the content type, accuracy requirements, performance needs, and model license. The `beir_benchmarks.py` script compares the retrieval accuracy of embedding models by using standardized information retrieval benchmarks from the BEIR framework. The script is included in the link:https://github.com/opendatahub-io/rag[RAG] repository, which provides demonstrations, benchmarking scripts, and deployment guides for the RAG stack on {openshift-platform}.

The examples use the `sentence-transformers` inference provider, which you can replace with another provider if required.

.Prerequisites
* You have cloned the `https://github.com/opendatahub-io/rag` repository.
* You have changed into the `/rag/benchmarks/beir-benchmarks` directory.
* You have initialized and activated a virtual environment.
* You have defined and installed the relevant script package dependencies to a `requirements.txt` file.
* You have built the Llama Stack starter distribution to install all dependencies.
* You have verified that your vector database is accessible and configured in the `run.yaml` file, and that any required embedding models were preloaded or registered with Llama Stack.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you run the benchmark script, the Llama Stack server must be running and a vector database provider must be enabled and reachable. If you plan to compare embedding models beyond the default set, you must also register those embedding models with Llama Stack.
====

.Procedure
. Optional: Start the Llama Stack server and enable a vector database provider
If you have not already started Llama Stack with a vector database provider enabled, start the server by using a configuration similar to one of the following examples:

* Using inline Milvus:
+
[subs=+quotes]
....
MILVUS_URL=milvus uv run llama stack run run.yaml
....

* Using remote PostgreSQL with pgvector:
+
[subs=+quotes]
....
ENABLE_PGVECTOR=true PGVECTOR_DB=pgvector PGVECTOR_USER=<user> PGVECTOR_PASSWORD=<password> uv run llama stack run run.yaml
....

. Optional: Register additional embedding models
The default supported embedding models are `granite-embedding-30m` and `granite-embedding-125m`, served by the `sentence-transformers` framework. If you want to benchmark additional embedding models, register them with Llama Stack before running the benchmark script.
+
For example, register an embedding model by using the Llama Stack client:
+
[subs=+quotes]
....
llama-stack-client models register all-MiniLM-L6-v2 \
  --provider-id sentence-transformers \
  --provider-model-id all-minilm:latest \
  --metadata '{"embedding_dimension": 384}' \
  --model-type embedding
....
+
[NOTE]
====
Any embedding models specified in the `--embedding-models` option must be registered before running the benchmark script.
====

. Run the `beir_benchmarks.py` benchmarking script.

* Enter the following command to use the configuration from `run.yaml` and the default dataset `scifact` with inline Milvus:
+
[subs=+quotes]
....
MILVUS_URL=milvus uv run python beir_benchmarks.py
....

* Enter the following command to run the benchmark by using remote PostgreSQL with pgvector:
+
[subs=+quotes]
....
ENABLE_PGVECTOR=true PGVECTOR_DB=pgvector uv run python beir_benchmarks.py \
  --vector-db-provider-id pgvector
....

* Alternatively, enter the following command to connect to a custom Llama Stack server:
+
[subs=+quotes]
....
LLAMA_STACK_URL="http://localhost:8321" MILVUS_URL=milvus uv run python beir_benchmarks.py
....

. Use environment variables and command line options to modify the benchmark run. For example, set the environment variable for the vector database provider before executing the script.

* Enter the following command to use a larger batch size for document ingestion:
+
[subs=+quotes]
....
MILVUS_URL=milvus uv run python beir_benchmarks.py --batch-size 300
....

* Enter the following command to benchmark multiple datasets, for example, `scifact` and `scidocs`:
+
[subs=+quotes]
....
MILVUS_URL=milvus uv run python beir_benchmarks.py \
  --dataset-names scifact scidocs
....

* Enter the following command to compare embedding models, for example, `granite-embedding-30m` and `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`:
+
[subs=+quotes]
....
MILVUS_URL=milvus uv run python beir_benchmarks.py \
  --embedding-models granite-embedding-30m all-MiniLM-L6-v2
....
+
[NOTE]
====
Ensure that `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` is registered with Llama Stack before running this command. See step 2 for registration instructions.
====

* Enter the following command to use a custom BEIR compatible dataset:
+
[subs=+quotes]
....
MILVUS_URL=milvus uv run python beir_benchmarks.py \
  --dataset-names my-dataset \
  --custom-datasets-urls https://example.com/my-beir-dataset.zip
....

* Enter the following command to change the vector database provider:
+
[subs=+quotes]
....
# Use remote PostgreSQL with pgvector
ENABLE_PGVECTOR=true PGVECTOR_DB=llama-stack PGVECTOR_USER=<user> PGVECTOR_PASSWORD=<password> uv run python beir_benchmarks.py \
  --vector-db-provider-id pgvector
....

.Verification
To verify that the benchmark completed successfully and to review the results, perform the following steps:

. Locate the `results` directory. All output files are saved to the following path:
+
[subs=+quotes]
`<path-to>/rag/benchmarks/beir-benchmarks/results`

. Examine the output. Compare your results with the sample output structure. The report includes performance metrics such as `map@cut_k` and `ndcg@cut_k` for each dataset and embedding model pair. The script also calculates a statistical significance test called a p value.
+
*Example output for `scifact` and `map_cut_10`:*
+
[subs=+quotes]
....
scifact map_cut_10
 granite-embedding-125m : 0.6879
 granite-embedding-30m  : 0.6578
 p_value                : 0.0150

 p_value < 0.05 indicates a statistically significant difference.
 The granite-embedding-125m model performs better for this dataset and metric.
....

. Interpret the results. A p value below `0.05` indicates that the performance difference between models is statistically significant. The model with the higher metric value performs better. Use these results to identify which embedding model performs best for your dataset.
