= Adding a tested and verified model-serving runtime for the multi-model serving platform

In addition to preinstalled and custom model-serving runtimes, you can also use {org-name} tested and verified model-serving runtimes such as the link:https://developer.nvidia.com/triton-inference-server[NVIDIA Triton Inference Server] to support your needs. For more information about {org-name} tested and verified runtimes, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7089743[Tested and verified runtimes for {productname-long}^].

You can use the {productname-long} dashboard to add and enable the *NVIDIA Triton Inference Server* runtime and then choose the runtime when you create a new model server for the multi-model serving platform.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-short} as a user with {productname-short} administrator privileges.
ifdef::upstream[]
* You are familiar with how to link:{odhdocshome}/serving-models/#adding-a-model-server-for-the-multi-model-serving-platform_model-serving[add a model server to your project]. After you have added a tested and verified model-serving runtime, you must configure a new model server to use the runtime.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Settings* > *Serving runtimes*.
+
The *Serving runtimes* page opens and shows the model-serving runtimes that are already installed and enabled.

. To add a tested and verified runtime, click *Add serving runtime*.
. In the *Select the model serving platforms this runtime supports* list, select *Multi-model serving platform*.
+
NOTE: The multi-model serving platform supports only the REST protocol. Therefore, you cannot change the default value in the *Select the API protocol this runtime supports* list.
. Click *Start from scratch*.
. Enter or paste the following YAML code directly in the embedded editor.

. In the `metadata.name` field, make sure that the value of the runtime you are adding does not match a runtime that you have already added).

. Optional: To use a custom display name for the runtime that you are adding, add a `metadata.annotations.openshift.io/display-name` field and specify a value, as shown in the following example:

NOTE: If you do not configure a custom display name for your runtime, {productname-short} shows the value of the `metadata.name` field.

. Click *Create*.
+
The *Serving runtimes* page opens and shows the updated list of runtimes that are installed. Observe that the runtime you added is automatically enabled.

. Optional: To edit the runtime, click the action menu (&#8942;) and select *Edit*.

.Verification
* The model-serving runtime that you added is shown in an enabled state on the *Serving runtimes* page.
