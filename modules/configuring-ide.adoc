= Configuring your IDE

[role='_abstract']
You can configure some notebook workbenches to get the most out of your data science work.

== Configuring VS Code

Incorporating standard database clients into your VS Code environment can streamline your workflow, offering a seamless interface for managing databases. You can incorporate different Database Management System (DBMS) clients into your Code Server workbench through built-in VS Code extensions or by creating a custom notebook image using Dockerfile.

=== Incorporating DBMS clients using VS Code extensions

ifndef::upstream[]
* If you use specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you use specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* You have created a data science project that has a Code Server workbench.

.Procedure

. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Data Science Projects*.
+

=== Incorporating DBMS clients using a custom image

Custom notebook images are a powerful tool when working with containerized environments, especially in scenarios where you need specific libraries, OS packages, or applications that are not readily available in base images. Follow these steps to create a custom notebook image with Database Management System (DBMS) clients for MongoDB, MSSQL, and PostgreSQL using Dockerfile.

* You have installed Docker on your system.


.Procedure

. Clone the Open Data Hub *notebooks* repository:
+
----
git clone git@github.com:opendatahub-io/notebooks.git
----

. From your local version of the repository, go to the `codeserver` folder and create a new folder for your custom image. For example, `ubi9-python-3.9-db-clients`. 
. Inside this folder, create a Dockerfile with the following contents:
+
----
# The base image is auto-assigned by the make recipe on the next step. In this case, this is your Code Server notebook.

ARG BASE_IMAGE
FROM ${BASE_IMAGE}

WORKDIR /opt/app-root/bin

# Install OS packages as root
USER root

# Install necessary OS packages
RUN dnf install -y unixODBC postgresql

# Install MongoDB Client
COPY mongodb-org-6.0.repo-x86_64 /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-6.0.repo
RUN dnf install -y mongocli

# Install MSSQL Client
COPY mssql-2022.repo-x86_64 /etc/yum.repos.d/mssql-2022.repo
RUN ACCEPT_EULA=Y dnf install -y mssql-tools18 unixODBC-devel
ENV PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools18/bin"

# Switch back to default user
USER 1001

WORKDIR /opt/app-root/src
----

. Create two RPM files, `mongodb-org-6.0.repo-x86_64` and `mssql-2022.repo-x86_64`, in the folder you created for your custom image.
+
*`mongodb-org-6.0.repo-x86_64` example file content:*

+
----
[mongodb-org-6.0]
name=MongoDB Repository
baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/redhat/9/mongodb-org/6.0/x86_64/
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-6.0.asc
----

+
*`mssql-2022.repo-x86_64` example file content:*

+
----
[packages-microsoft-com-prod]
name=packages-microsoft-com-prod
baseurl=https://packages.microsoft.com/rhel/9.0/prod/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
----

. To streamline the build and push process, update the Makefile with a new recipe:
+
----
.PHONY: codeserver-ubi9-python-3.9-db-clients
codeserver-ubi9-python-3.9-db-clients: codeserver-ubi9-python-3.9
    $(call image,$@,codeserver/ubi9-python-3.9-db-clients,$<)
----

. Run the following command to build and push the image:
+
Replace `${YOUR_USERNAME}` with your username. You can replace `quay.io` with any valid registry.

+
----
make codeserver-ubi9-python-3.9-db-clients -e IMAGE_REGISTRY=quay.io/${YOUR_USERNAME}/workbench-images
----

. After pushing the custom image, go to *Settings* -> *Notebooks Image Settings* -> *Import New Image*.
. Click *Import new image*.
+
The *Import Notebook images* dialog appears.
. In the *Image location* field, enter the URL of the repository containing your custom notebook image. For example: `quay.io/my-repo/my-image:tag`.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the notebook image.
. In the *Description* field, enter a description for the notebook image.
. Click *Import*.
+
The notebook image that you imported appears in the table on the *Notebook image settings* page.
. Create or open a data science project, create a new workbench, and select the custom image from the *Image Selection* drop-down list.
. Open a new terminal inside your Code Server workbench and run the following command to confirm that the database clients installed successfully:
+
----
yum list installed | grep -E 'mssql|mongo|postgresql'
----

+
A list of installed packages related to MongoDB, MSSQL, and PostgreSQL should appear.
