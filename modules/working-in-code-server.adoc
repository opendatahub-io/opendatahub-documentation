== Installing extensions with code-server

With the code-server workbench image, you can customize your code-server environment by using extensions to add new languages, themes, and debuggers, and to connect to additional services. You can also enhance the efficiency of your data science work with extensions for syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, and bracket matching. 

For details about the third-party extensions that you can install with code-server, see the link:https://open-vsx.org/[Open VSX Registry].
