= Creating a URI-compatible connection type using the connections API

[role='_abstract']

In {productname-short}, you can create a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) compatible connection type by using the connections API. In the following procedure, you define a Kubernetes Secret resource that holds a simple URI for connecting to an external resource, such as a model file hosted on an HTTP server or HuggingFace.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to a Kubernetes cluster where you have permissions to create Secrets.
* You have access to the full HTTP/HTTPS URL or HuggingFace URI (`hf://`) for the target resource.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file (e.g., `uri-connection.yaml`) that defines a Kubernetes `Secret` of type `Opaque`. This secret will contain the URI in the `stringData` section.
+
[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <connection-name>
  namespace: <your-namespace>
  annotations:
    opendatahub.io/connection-type-protocol: "uri"
type: Opaque
stringData:
  URI: "<uniform-resource-identifier>" # The full URI/URL of the external resource
----
+
.. In the example YAML, replace the required URI field by populating the placeholder value in  the `stringData` section to include complete URL to the resource. This can be an HTTP/HTTPS link, or a HuggingFace URI. 
+

NOTE: The `opendatahub.io/connection-type-protocol: "uri"` annotation is used by certain operators to identify the purpose of the Kubernetes Secret.

. Apply the Secret to the cluster by using the `kubectl apply` command to create the Secret in your Kubernetes cluster. 
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f uri-connection.yaml
