= Configuring a pipeline server with an external Amazon RDS database

To configure a pipeline server with an external Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) database, you must configure {productname-short} to trust the certificates issued by its certificate authorities (CA).

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are configuring a pipeline server for production pipeline workloads, {org-name} recommends that you use an external MySQL or MariaDB database. 
====

.Prerequisites
* You have cluster administrator privileges for your {openshift-platform} cluster.
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
* You have created a data science project that you can add a pipeline server to.
* You have an existing S3-compatible object storage bucket, and you have configured your storage account with write access to your S3 bucket.

.Procedure
. Before configuring your pipeline server, from link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions[Amazon RDS: Certificate bundles by AWS Region], download the PEM certificate bundle for the region that the database was created in. 
+
For example, if the database was created in the `us-east-1` region, download `us-east-1-bundle.pem`.
. In a terminal window, log in to the OpenShift cluster where {productname-short} is deployed.
+
----
oc login api.<cluster_name>.<cluster_domain>:6443 --web
----
. Run the following command to fetch the current {productname-short} trusted CA configuration and store it in a new file:
+
[source]
----
oc get dscinitializations.dscinitialization.opendatahub.io default-dsci -o json | jq '.spec.trustedCABundle.customCABundle' > /tmp/my-custom-ca-bundles.crt
----
. Run the following command to append the PEM certificate bundle that you downloaded to the new custom CA configuration file:
+
----
cat us-east-1-bundle.pem >> /tmp/my-custom-ca-bundles.crt
----
. Run the following command to update the {productname-short} trusted CA configuration to trust certificates issued by the CAs included in the new custom CA configuration file:
+
----
oc patch dscinitialization default-dsci --type='json' -p='[{"op":"replace","path":"/spec/trustedCABundle/customCABundle","value":"'"$(awk '{printf "%s\\n", $0}' /tmp/my-custom-ca-bundles.crt)"'"}]'

.Verification
* The pipeline server starts successfully.
* You can import and run data science pipelines.
