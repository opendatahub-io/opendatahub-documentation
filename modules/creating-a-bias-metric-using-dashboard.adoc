= Creating a bias metric by using the dashboard

[role='_abstract']
You can use the {productname-short} dashboard to create a bias metric for a model.

.Prerequisites
ifndef::upstream[]
* You are familiar with link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/monitoring_your_ai_systems/monitoring-model-bias_bias-monitoring#using-bias-metrics_bias-monitoring[the bias metrics that you can use with {productname-short}] and how to interpret them.
endif::[]

* You are familiar with link:{odhdocshome}/monitoring-your-ai-systems/#using-bias-metrics_bias-monitoring[the bias metrics that you can use with {productname-short}] and how to interpret them.
endif::[]

* You are familiar with the specific data set schema and understand the names and meanings of the inputs and outputs.

* Your OpenShift cluster administrator added you as a user to the {openshift-platform} cluster and has installed the TrustyAI service for the project that contains the deployed models.

* You set up TrustyAI for your project, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/monitoring_your_ai_systems/setting-up-trustyai-for-your-project_monitor#setting-up-trustyai-for-your-project_monitor[Setting up TrustyAI for your project].

.Procedure
. Optional: To set the `TRUSTY_ROUTE` variable, follow these steps. 
.. In a terminal window, log in to the OpenShift cluster where {productname-short} is deployed.
+
----
oc login
----

.. Set the `TRUSTY_ROUTE` variable to the external route for the TrustyAI service pod.
+
----
TRUSTY_ROUTE=https://$(oc get route/trustyai-service --template={{.spec.host}})
----
. In the left menu of the {productname-short} dashboard, click *AI hub* -> *Deployments*.
. On the *Deployments* page, select your project from the drop-down list.
. Click the name of the model that you want to configure bias metrics for.
. On the metrics page for the model, click the *Model bias* tab.
. Click *Configure*.
. In the *Configure bias metrics* dialog, complete the following steps to configure bias metrics:
.. In the *Metric name* field, type a unique name for your bias metric. Note that you cannot change the name of this metric later.
.. From the *Metric type* list, select one of the metrics types that are available in {productname-short}.
.. In the *Protected attribute* field, type the name of an attribute in your model that you want to monitor for bias.
+ 
TIP: You can use a `curl` command to query the metadata endpoint and view input attribute names and values. For example: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $TRUSTY_ROUTE/info | jq ".[0].data.inputSchema"`
.. In the *Privileged value* field, type the name of a privileged group for the protected attribute that you specified.
.. In the *Unprivileged value* field, type the name of an unprivileged group for the protected attribute that you specified.
.. In the *Output* field, type the name of the model outcome that you want to monitor for bias.
+ 
TIP: You can use a `curl` command to query the metadata endpoint and view output attribute names and values. For example: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $TRUSTY_ROUTE/info | jq ".[0].data.outputSchema"`

.. In the *Output value* field, type the value of the outcome that you want to monitor for bias.
.. In the *Violation threshold* field, type the bias threshold for your selected metric type. This threshold value defines how far the specified metric can be from the fairness value for your metric, before the model is considered biased. 
.. In the *Metric batch size* field, type the number of model inferences that {productname-short} includes each time it calculates the metric.
. Ensure that the values you entered are correct.
+
[NOTE]
====
You cannot edit a model bias metric configuration after you create it. Instead, you can duplicate a metric and then edit (configure) it; however, the history of the original metric is not applied to the copy.
====
. Click *Configure*.

.Verification
* The *Bias metric configuration* page shows the bias metrics that you configured for your model.

.Next step
To view metrics, on the *Bias metric configuration* page, click *View metrics* in the upper-right corner.
