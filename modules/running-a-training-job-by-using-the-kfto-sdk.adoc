= Running a training job by using the Training Operator SDK

[role='_abstract']
When you run a training job to tune a model, you must specify the resources needed, and provide any authorization credentials required. 

[NOTE]
====
The code in this procedure specifies how to run the example training job. 
If you have the specified resources, you can run the example code without editing it.

Alternatively, you can modify the example code to specify the appropriate details for your training job.
====

.Prerequisites

* You can access an OpenShift cluster that has sufficient worker nodes with supported accelerators to run your training or tuning job.


ifndef::upstream[]
* You can access a workbench that is suitable for distributed training, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_distributed_workloads/preparing-the-distributed-training-environment_distributed-workloads#creating-a-workbench-for-distributed-training_distributed-workloads[Creating a workbench for distributed training].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* You can access a workbench that is suitable for distributed training, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-distributed-workloads/#creating-a-workbench-for-distributed-training_distributed-workloads[Creating a workbench for distributed training].
endif::[]

* You have administrator access for the data science project.
** If you created the project, you automatically have administrator access. 
** If you did not create the project, your cluster administrator must give you administrator access.

* Optional: If you want to enforce the use of local queues, the local-queue labeling policy is enabled for your project namespace.

ifndef::upstream[]
For more information about enforcing the use of local queues, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/managing_openshift_ai/managing-distributed-workloads_managing-rhoai#enforcing-lqlabel-all_managing-rhoai[Enforcing the local-queue labeling policy for all projects] or link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/managing_openshift_ai/managing-distributed-workloads_managing-rhoai#enforcing-lqlabel-some_managing-rhoai[Enforcing the local-queue labeling policy for some projects only].
+
If the local-queue labeling policy is enabled for your namespace, you have created resource flavor, cluster queue, and local queue Kueue objects for your data science project. For more information about creating these objects, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/managing_openshift_ai/index#configuring-quota-management-for-distributed-workloads_managing-rhoai[Configuring quota management for distributed workloads].

* You have access to a model.
* You have access to data that you can use to train the model.

* You have configured the training job as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_distributed_workloads/running-kfto-based-distributed-training-workloads_distributed-workloads#configuring-a-training-job-by-using-the-kfto-sdk_distributed-workloads[Configuring a training job by using the Training Operator SDK].

.Procedure
. Open the workbench, as follows:
.. Log in to the {productname-long} web console.
.. Click *Data science projects* and click your project.
.. Click the *Workbenches* tab. 
If your workbench is not already running, start the workbench.
.. Click the *Open* link to open the IDE in a new window. 

. Click *File -> Open*, and open the notebook that you used to configure the training job.

. Create a cell to run the job, and add the following content:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
from kubernetes import client

# Start PyTorchJob with 2 Workers and 2 GPU per Worker (multi-node, multi-worker job).
client.create_job(
   name="pytorch-ddp",
   train_func=train_func,
   base_image="quay.io/modh/training:py311-cuda124-torch251",
   num_workers=2,
   resources_per_worker={"nvidia.com/gpu": "2"},
   packages_to_install=["torchvision==0.19.0"],
   env_vars={"NCCL_DEBUG": "INFO", "TORCH_DISTRIBUTED_DEBUG": "DETAIL"},
   labels={"key": "value"}, 
   annotations={"key": "value"}
)
----

. Edit the content to specify the appropriate values for your environment, as follows:

.. Edit the `num_workers` value to specify the number of worker nodes.
.. Update the `resources_per_worker` values according to the job requirements and the resources available.
.. The example provided is for NVIDIA GPUs. If you use AMD accelerators, make the following additional changes:

* In the `resources_per_worker` entry, change `nvidia.com/gpu` to `amd.com/gpu`
* Change the `base_image` value to `quay.io/modh/training:py311-rocm62-torch251`
* Remove the `NCCL_DEBUG` entry
* If the local-queue labeling policy is enabled, add a `labels` entry for the local queue object in your project namespace:
+
[source]
----
client.create_job(
    name="pytorch-ddp"
...
    labels={"kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name": "<local-queue-name>"}
...
)

----
+
[NOTE] 
====
This example does not specify the `job_kind` parameter.
If the `job_kind` value is not explicitly set, the `TrainingClient` API automatically sets the `job_kind` value to `PyTorchJob`.
====

. Run the cell to run the job.


.Verification
View the progress of the job as follows:

. Create a cell with the following content:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
client.get_job_logs(
    name="pytorch-ddp",
    job_kind="PyTorchJob",
    follow=True,
)
----

. Run the cell to view the job progress.
