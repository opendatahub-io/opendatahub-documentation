= Enabling Intel Gaudi AI Accelerators

[role='_abstract']
Before you can use Intel Gaudi AI Accelerators in {productname-short}, you must install the necessary dependencies and deploy the HabanaAI Operator. 

.Prerequisites
ifdef::upstream,self-managed[]
* You have logged in to {openshift-platform}.
* You have the `cluster-admin` role in {openshift-platform}.
endif::[]
ifdef::cloud-service[]
* You have logged in to OpenShift.
* You have the `cluster-admin` role in OpenShift.
endif::[]

.Procedure
. To enable Intel Gaudi AI Accelerators in {productname-short}, follow the instructions at link:https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Orchestration/HabanaAI_Operator/index.html[HabanaAI Operator for OpenShift].
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Settings* -> *Accelerator profiles*.
+
The *Accelerator profiles* page appears, displaying existing accelerator profiles. To enable or disable an existing accelerator profile, on the row containing the relevant accelerator profile, click the toggle in the *Enable* column.
. Click *Create accelerator profile*. 
+
The *Create accelerator profile* dialog opens.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the Intel Gaudi AI Accelerator.
. In the *Identifier* field, enter a unique string that identifies the Intel Gaudi AI Accelerator, for example, `habana.ai/gaudi`. 
. Optional: In the *Description* field, enter a description for the Intel Gaudi AI Accelerator.
. To enable or disable the accelerator profile for the Intel Gaudi AI Accelerator immediately after creation, click the toggle in the *Enable* column.
. Optional: Add a toleration to schedule pods with matching taints.
.. Click *Add toleration*. 
+
The *Add toleration* dialog opens.
.. From the *Operator* list, select one of the following options:
* *Equal* - The *key/value/effect* parameters must match. This is the default.
* *Exists* - The *key/effect* parameters must match. You must leave a blank value parameter, which matches any.
.. From the *Effect* list, select one of the following options:
* *None* 
* *NoSchedule* - New pods that do not match the taint are not scheduled onto that node. Existing pods on the node remain.
* *PreferNoSchedule* - New pods that do not match the taint might be scheduled onto that node, but the scheduler tries not to. Existing pods on the node remain.
* *NoExecute* - New pods that do not match the taint cannot be scheduled onto that node. Existing pods on the node that do not have a matching toleration are removed.
.. In the *Key* field, enter the toleration key `habana.ai/gaudi`. The key is any string, up to 253 characters. The key must begin with a letter or number, and may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores.
.. In the *Value* field, enter a toleration value. The value is any string, up to 63 characters. The value must begin with a letter or number, and may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores.
.. In the *Toleration Seconds* section, select one of the following options to specify how long a pod stays bound to a node that has a node condition. 
** *Forever* - Pods stays permanently bound to a node. 
** *Custom value* - Enter a value, in seconds, to define how long pods stay bound to a node that has a node condition.
.. Click *Add*.
. Click *Create accelerator profile*.

.Verification
* From the *Administrator* perspective, the following Operators appear on the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page.
** HabanaAI
** Node Feature Discovery (NFD)
** Kernel Module Management (KMM)
* The *Accelerator* list displays the Intel Gaudi AI Accelerator on the *Start a notebook server* page. After you select an accelerator, the *Number of accelerators* field appears, which you can use to choose the number of accelerators for your notebook server. 
* The accelerator profile appears on the *Accelerator profiles* page
* The accelerator profile appears on the *Instances* tab on the details page for the `AcceleratorProfile` custom resource definition (CRD).
