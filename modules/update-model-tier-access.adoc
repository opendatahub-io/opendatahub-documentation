= Update tier access for deployed models

[role="_abstract"]
After deploying a model to Models-as-a-Service (MaaS), you can modify which service tiers have access without redeploying the model.

.Prerequisites

* You have logged in to {productname-short}.
* You have administrator access to a project in {productname-short}.
* You have deployed a model and published it to Models-as-a-Service.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Projects* and click your project name.
. Click the *Deployments* tab.
. Click the model deployment name.
. Click *Edit* from the actions menu.
. In the *Advanced settings* section, modify the *Tier access* settings:
.. Change between *All tiers* and *Specific tiers*.
.. Update the tier selections if using specific tiers.
. Click *Update*.
+
[WARNING]
====
Changing tier access takes effect immediately. Users who lose access will receive 403 Forbidden errors on their next API request.
====

.Verification

. Verify that the tier access changes were applied:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get rolebindings -n <your-project-namespace> | grep <your_model_name>
----
+
You should see RoleBindings for each tier that has access.
+
. Test functional access:
.. Verify that users in authorized tiers can access the model through the MaaS interface.
.. If you restricted access to specific tiers, verify that users in unauthorized tiers receive 403 errors.
