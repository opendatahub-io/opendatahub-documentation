= Deleting a pipeline version

[role='_abstract']
You can delete specific versions of a pipeline when you no longer require them. Deleting a default pipeline version automatically changes the default pipeline version to the next most recent version. If no pipeline versions exist, the pipeline persists without a default version. 

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* You have previously created a data science project that is available and contains a pipeline server.
* You have imported a pipeline to an active pipeline server.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Data Science Pipelines*.
+
The *Pipelines* page opens.
. Delete the pipeline versions that you no longer require:
* To delete a single pipeline version:
.. From the *Project* list, select the project that contains a version of a pipeline that you want to delete.
.. On the row containing the pipeline, click *Expand* (image:images/rhoai-expand-icon.png[]).
.. Click the action menu (*&#8942;*) beside the project version that you want to delete, and then click *Delete pipeline version*.
+
The *Delete pipeline version* dialog opens.
.. Enter the name of the pipeline version in the text field to confirm that you intend to delete it.
.. Click *Delete*.
* To delete multiple pipeline versions:
.. On the row containing each pipeline version that you want to delete, select the checkbox. 
.. Click the action menu (&#8942;) next to the *Import pipeline* drop-down list, and then select *Delete* from the list.

.Verification
* The pipeline version that you deleted no longer appears on the *Pipelines* page, or on the *Pipelines* tab for the data science project.
