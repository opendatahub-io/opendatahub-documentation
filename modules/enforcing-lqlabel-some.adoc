= Enforcing the local-queue labeling policy for some projects only

[role='_abstract']
When the local-queue labeling policy is enforced, Ray clusters and PyTorchJobs are created _only if_ they are configured to use a local queue, and the Ray cluster and PyTorchJob resources are then managed by Kueue.
Disabling the policy means that it is possible to create Ray clusters or PyTorchJobs that do not use a local queue, but the resources of such Ray clusters or PyTorchJobs are not managed by Kueue.

The Validating Admission Policy is enforced on both RayCluster and PyTorchJob resources.

The local-queue labeling policy is enforced for all projects by default. To enforce the local-queue labeling policy for _some_ projects only, follow these steps.

.Procedure

. In the {openshift-platform} console, open the *Administrator* perspective.
. From the *Project* list, select *All Projects*.
. Click *Home* -> *Search*.
. In the *Resources* list, search for *ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding*.
. Click the `kueue-validating-admission-policy-binding` entry to open the details page.
. Click the *YAML* tab to show the binding specifications.
. Edit the `namespaceSelector` field to delete the `{}` value, and add the `matchLabels` and `kueue.openshift.io/managed` values as shown in the following example:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `kueue.openshift.io/managed=true` label is supported for {productname-short} projects only.

. Click *Save*.

. Add the `kueue.openshift.io/managed` label to each project for which you want to enforce this policy, by running the following command:

.Verification 

. Create two projects: Project A and Project B.
. Add the `kueue.openshift.io/managed` label to Project A only.
. In each project, try to create a Ray cluster or PyTorchJob.
