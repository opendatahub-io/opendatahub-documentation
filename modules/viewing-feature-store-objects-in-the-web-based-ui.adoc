= Viewing Feature Store objects in the web-based UI

[role='_abstract']
You can use the Feature Store Web UI to view all registered features, data sources, entities, and feature services.

.Prerequisites

* You can access the OpenShift console.
* You have installed the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI). See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI^].

* You have enabled the Feature Store component, as described in _Enabling the Feature Store component_.

* You have created a Feature Store CRD, as described in _Creating a Feature Store instance in a data science project_.

.Procedure

. In the OpenShift console, select *Administration* -> *CustomResourceDefinitions*.
. To filter the list, in the *Search by Name* field, enter *feature*.
. Click the *FeatureStore* CRD and then click *Instances*.
. Click the name of the instance that corresponds to the metadata name you specified when you created the Feature Store instance.
. Edit the YAML to include a reference to `services.ui` in the `spec` section, as shown in the following example:
+
----
spec:
 feastProject: credit_scoring_local
 feastProjectDir:
   git:
     ref: 598a270
     url: 'https://github.com/feast-dev/feast-credit-score-local-tutorial'
 services:
   ui: {}
----
. Click *Save* and then click *Reload*.
+
The Feature Store Operator starts a container for the web-based Feature Store UI and creates an OpenShift route that provides the URL so that you can access it. 

. In the {openshift-platform} console, select *Workloads* -> *Pods*.
. Make sure that your project (for example, `my-ds-project`) is selected.
+
You should see a deployment for the web-based UI. Note that OpenShift enables TLS by default at runtime.

. To populate the web-based UI with the objects in your Feature Store instance:
.. In the OpenShift console, select *Workloads* -> *Pods*. 
.. Make sure that your project (for example, `my-ds-project`) is selected. 
.. Click the `feast` pod and then select *Pod details*. 
.. Click **Terminal**. 
.. To update the Feature Store instance, enter the following command:
+
----
feast apply
----

. To find the URL for the Feature Store UI, in the OpenShift console, click *Networking* -> *Routes*. 
+
In the row for the Feature Store UI, for example `feast-sample-ui`, the URL is in the *Location* column. 

. Click the URL link to open it in your default web browser.


.Verification

The Feature Store Web UI is displayed and shows the feature objects in your project as shown in the following figure:
