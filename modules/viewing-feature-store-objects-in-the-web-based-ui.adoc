= Viewing feature store objects in the web-based UI

[role='_abstract']
You can use the Feature Store Web UI to view all registered features, data sources, entities, and feature services.

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator privileges for your {openshift-platform} cluster.
* You have installed the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI). See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI^].
* You have installed the Kubernetes Command line tool (kubectl). See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl[Command line tool (kubectl)^].

* You have enabled the Feature Store component, as described in _Enabling the Feature Store component_.

.Procedure

. In the OpenShift console, click the *Quick Create* (image:images/quick-create-icon.png[]) icon and then click the *Import YAML* option.
. Verify that your data science project is the selected project.
. Copy the following code and paste it into the YAML editor:  
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: feast.dev/v1alpha1
kind: FeatureStore
metadata:
  name: sample
spec:
  feastProject: my_project
  services:
	  ui: {}  # <1>
----
<1> Specifies to create a Web UI for the feature store instance.

. Click *Create*.
+
The Feature Store Operator starts a container for the web-based Feature Store UI and creates an OpenShift route that provides the URL so that you can access it. 

. In the {openshift-platform} console, select *Workloads* -> *Pods*.
. Make sure that your project (for example, `my-ds-project`) is selected.
+
You should see a deployment for the web-based UI. Note that OpenShift enables TLS by default at runtime.

. To populate the web-based UI with the objects in your feature store, create an OpenShift cron job:
.. Open a terminal window.
.. If you are not already logged in to your {openshift-platform} cluster as a cluster administrator, log in as shown in the following example:
+
----
$ oc login __<openshift_cluster_url>__ -u __<admin_username>__ -p __<password>__
----

.. Make sure that you are using the data science project in which you enabled Feature Store, for example, `my-ds-project`.
+
----
$ oc project my-ds-project
----

.. Create a cron job by running a command with the following syntax:
+
----
$ kubectl create job --from=cronjob/feast-<FeatureStore CR name> feast-apply
----
+
For example, if the metadata.name in the Feature Store CRD is sample, run the following command: 
+
----
$ kubectl create job --from=cronjob/feast-sample feast-apply
----

.. Run the following commands:
+
----
$ kubectl wait --for=condition=complete job/feast-apply

$ kubectl logs job/feast-apply --all-containers=true
----

. To find the URL for the Feature Store UI, in the OpenShift console, click *Networking* -> *Routes*. 
+
In the row for the Feature Store UI, for example `feast-sample-ui`, the URL is in the *Location* column. 

. Click the URL link to open it in your default web browser.


.Verification

The Feature Store Web UI appears and shows the feature objects in your project as shown in Figure 2:
