=  Explore the Training Hub examples

The Training Hub repository hosts multiple cookbooks for using different LLM algorithms such as supervised fine tuning (SFT) and Orthogonal Subspace Fine Tuning (OSFT)/Continual Learning. OSFT is a training algorithm built by the {org-name} AI Innovation team. With OSFT, you can continually post-train a fine-tuned model to expand its knowledge on new data. You can tinker with the Training Hub cookbooks from a workbench within your {productname-short} project. 

To get started with the Training Hub, explore the provided examples.
