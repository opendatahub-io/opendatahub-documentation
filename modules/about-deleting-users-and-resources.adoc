= About deleting users and their resources

If you have administrator access to {openshift-platform}, you can revoke a user's access to workbenches and delete the user's resources from {productname-long}.

Deleting a user and the user's resources involves the following tasks:

* Before you delete a user from {productname-short}, it is good practice to back up the data on your persistent volume claims (PVCs). 

* Stop notebook servers owned by the user.

* Revoke user access to workbenches.

* Remove the user from the allowed group in your OpenShift identity provider.

* After you delete a user, delete their associated configuration files from {openshift-platform}.
