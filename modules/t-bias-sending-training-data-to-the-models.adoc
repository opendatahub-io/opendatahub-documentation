[id="t-bias-sending-training-data-to-the-models_{context}"]
= Sending training data to the models

Pass the training data through the models to be able to compute baseline fairness values.

.Procedure

* In a terminal window, run the following command from the directory containing the downloaded tutorial files (`odh-trustyai-demos-main`):
+
[source]
----
for batch in 0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 2250; do
  2-BiasMonitoring/scripts/send_data_batch
2-BiasMonitoring/data/training/$batch.json
done
----
+
This process can take several minutes. 

.Verification

The script returns verification messages indicating whether TrustyAI is receiving the data, but you can also verify in the cluster metrics:

. In the {openshift-platform} web console, click *Observe* -> *Metrics*.
. In the *Expression* field, enter `trustyai_model_observations_total` and click *Run Queries*. 
+
You should see both models listed with around 2250 inferences each, indicating that TrustyAI has cataloged enough inputs and outputs to begin analysis.

. Optional: After running a query, you can select a time range and refresh interval.
  * From the *Time range* list, select 5 minutes.
  * From the *Refresh interval* list, select 15 seconds.
