= Uploading a pipeline version

[role='_abstract']
You can upload a YAML file to an active pipeline server that contains the latest version of your pipeline, or you can upload the YAML file from a URL. The YAML file must consist of a Kubeflow pipeline compiled by using the Kubeflow compiler. After you upload a pipeline version to a pipeline server, you can execute it by creating a pipeline run.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group} ) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* You have previously created a data science project that is available and contains a configured pipeline server.
* You have a pipeline version available and ready to upload. 
* If you are uploading your pipeline version from a URL, the URL is publicly accessible. 

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Data Science Pipelines*.
. On the *Pipelines* page, from the *Project* drop-down list, select the project that you want to upload a pipeline version to.
. Click the *Import pipeline* drop-down list, and then select *Upload new version*.
. In the *Upload new version* dialog, enter the details for the pipeline version that you are uploading.
.. From the *Pipeline* list, select the pipeline that you want to upload your pipeline version to.
