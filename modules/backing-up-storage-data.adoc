= Backing up storage data

[role='_abstract']
It is a best practice to back up the data on your persistent volume claims (PVCs) regularly.

Backing up your data is particularly important before you delete a user and before you uninstall {productname-short}, as all PVCs are deleted when {productname-short} is uninstalled.

See the documentation for your cluster platform for more information about backing up your PVCs.
