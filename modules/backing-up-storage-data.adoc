= Backing up storage data

[role='_abstract']
Red Hat recommends that you back up the data on your persistent volume claims (PVCs) regularly.
Backing up your data is particularly important before deleting a user and before uninstalling {productname-short}, as all PVCs are deleted when {productname-short} is uninstalled.

See the documentation for your cluster platform for more information about backing up your PVCs.
