[role="_abstract"]
pgvector is an open source PostgreSQL extension that enables vector similarity search on embedding data stored in relational tables. In {productname-short}, PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension is supported as a remote vector database provider for the Llama Stack Operator. pgvector supports retrieval augmented generation workflows that require persistent vector storage while integrating with existing PostgreSQL environments.

pgvector vector databases provide the following capabilities in {productname-short}:

* Storage of vector embeddings in PostgreSQL tables.
* Similarity search across embeddings by using pgvector distance metrics.
* Persistent storage of vectors alongside structured relational data.
* Integration with existing PostgreSQL security and operational tooling.

In a typical retrieval augmented generation workflow in {productname-short}, your application uses the following components:

* *Inference provider*  
Generates embeddings and model responses.

* *Vector store provider*  
Stores embeddings and performs similarity search. When you use pgvector, PostgreSQL provides this capability as a remote vector store.

* *File storage provider*  
Stores the source files that are ingested into vector stores.

* *Llama Stack server*  
Provides a unified API surface, including an OpenAI compatible Vector Stores API.

When you ingest content, Llama Stack splits source material into chunks, generates embeddings, and stores them in PostgreSQL through the pgvector extension. When you query a vector store, Llama Stack performs similarity search and returns the most relevant chunks for use in prompts.

In {productname-short}, pgvector is used in the following operational mode:

* *Remote PostgreSQL with pgvector*, which runs as a standalone PostgreSQL database service accessed by the Llama Stack server. This mode is suitable for development and production workloads that require persistent storage and integration with existing PostgreSQL infrastructure.

When you deploy PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension, you typically manage the following components:

* *Secrets* for PostgreSQL connection credentials.
* *Persistent storage* for durable database data.
* *A PostgreSQL service* that exposes a network endpoint.

PostgreSQL with pgvector does not require an external coordination service. Vector data, indexes, and metadata are stored directly in PostgreSQL tables and managed through standard database mechanisms.

Use PostgreSQL with pgvector when you require persistent vector storage and want to integrate vector search into existing PostgreSQL based data platforms within {productname-short}.
