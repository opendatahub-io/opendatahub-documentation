= Managing model registry permissions 

[role='_abstract']
You can manage access to a model registry for individual users and user groups in your organization, and for service accounts in a project.

[NOTE]
====
{productname-short} creates the `<model-registry-name>-users` group automatically for use with model registries. You can add users to this group in OpenShift, or ask the cluster administrator to do so.

ifndef::upstream[]
The model registry operator uses {openshift-platform} Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and creates various RBAC resources in the `rhoai-model-registries` namespace.
endif::[]

ifdef::upstream[]
The model registry operator uses {openshift-platform} Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and creates various RBAC resources in the `odh-model-registries` namespace.
endif::[]

For each model registry instance, the operator creates a `registry-users-<model registry instance name>` role and an {openshift-platform} group called `<model registry instance name>-users`. To grant an individual user, service account, or group access to a model registry instance, your cluster administrator must create a role binding to the `registry-users-<model registry instance name>` role for the instance.

The `<model registry instance name>-users` group has a role binding to the `registry-users-<model registry instance name>` role. Your cluster administrator can add users to this group to grant them access to the model registry instance without needing to create a role binding for each user.
