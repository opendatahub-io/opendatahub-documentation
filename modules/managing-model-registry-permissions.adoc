= Managing model registry permissions 

[role='_abstract']
You can manage access to a model registry for individual users and user groups in your organization, and for service accounts in a project.

{productname-short} creates the `<model-registry-name>-users` group automatically for use with model registries. You can add users to this group in OpenShift, or ask the cluster admin to do so.

.Prerequisites

* An available model registry exists in your deployment.
ifdef::upstream[]
* The users and groups that you want to provide access to already exist in {openshift-platform}. For more information, see
link:{odhdocshome}/managing-odh/#managing-users-and-groups[Managing users and groups].
endif::[]
