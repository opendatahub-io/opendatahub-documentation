= Enabling GPU support in {productname-short}

[role='_abstract']
Optionally, to ensure that your data scientists can use compute-heavy workloads in their models, you can enable graphics processing units (GPUs) in {productname-short}. 

//the following note applies to self-managed connected only
ifdef::self-managed[]
ifndef::disconnected[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using {productname-short} in a disconnected self-managed environment, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/installing_and_uninstalling_{url-productname-short}_in_a_disconnected_environment/enabling-gpu-support_install[Enabling GPU support in {productname-short}] instead.

//the following note applies to cloud service only

ifndef::upstream[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
The NVIDIA GPU Add-on is no longer supported. Instead, enable GPUs by installing the NVIDIA GPU Operator. If your deployment has a previously-installed NVIDIA GPU Add-on, before you install the NVIDIA GPU Operator, use OpenShift Cluster Manager to uninstall the NVIDIA GPU Add-on from your cluster.

.Procedure
//the following step applies to cloud service, self-managed connected, and upstream
ifndef::disconnected[]
. To enable GPU support on an OpenShift cluster, follow the instructions here: link:https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/openshift/latest/index.html[NVIDIA GPU Operator on {org-name} OpenShift Container Platform^] in the NVIDIA documentation.
endif::[]
//the following step applies to self-managed disconnected only
ifdef::disconnected[]
. To enable GPU support on an OpenShift cluster in a disconnected or airgapped environment, follow the instructions here: link:https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/openshift/latest/mirror-gpu-ocp-disconnected.html[Deploy GPU Operators in a disconnected or airgapped environment^] in the NVIDIA documentation.
endif::[]
//the following step applies to downstream only: self-managed (connected and disconnected) and cloud service
ifndef::upstream[]
. After installing the NVIDIA GPU Operator, create an accelerator profile as described in link:{odhdocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/working-on-data-science-projects/#working-with-accelerator-profiles_accelerators[Working with accelerator profiles].
endif::[]
//the following step applies to upstream only
ifdef::upstream[]
. After installing the NVIDIA GPU Operator, create an accelerator profile as described in  link:{odhdocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/working-on-data-science-projects/#working-with-accelerator-profiles_accelerators[Working with accelerator profiles].
