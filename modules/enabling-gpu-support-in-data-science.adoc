= Enabling GPU support in {productname-short}

[role='_abstract']
Optionally, to ensure that your data scientists can use compute-heavy workloads in their models, you can enable graphics processing units (GPUs) in {productname-short}. To enable GPUs on OpenShift, follow these steps:

. Install the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/specialized_hardware_and_driver_enablement/node-feature-discovery-operator[Node Feature Discovery Operator] (a prerequisite to installing the NVIDIA GPU Operator).
. Install the NVIDIA GPU Operator. For information, see link:https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/openshift/latest/index.html[NVIDIA GPU Operator on {org-name} OpenShift Container Platform^] in the NVIDIA documentation.
. Create an accelerator profile.

ifndef::self-managed[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
The NVIDIA GPU Add-on is no longer supported. Instead, enable GPUs by installing the NVIDIA GPU Operator. If your deployment has a previously-installed NVIDIA GPU Add-on, before you install the NVIDIA GPU Operator, use OpenShift Cluster Manager to uninstall the NVIDIA GPU Add-on from your cluster.

ifndef::disconnected[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
Follow the instructions in this chapter only if you want to enable GPU support in an unrestricted self-managed environment. To enable GPU support in a disconnected self-managed environment, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/installing_and_uninstalling_{url-productname-short}_in_a_disconnected_environment/enabling-gpu-support_install[Enabling GPU support in {productname-short}] instead.

ifdef::disconnected[]
Follow the instructions in this chapter only if you want to enable GPU support in a disconnected self-managed environment. For more information on GPU enablement on a OpenShift cluster in a disconnected or airgapped environment, see link:https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/openshift/latest/mirror-gpu-ocp-disconnected.html[Deploy GPU Operators in a disconnected or airgapped environment^] in the NVIDIA documentation.
