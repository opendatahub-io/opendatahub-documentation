[role='_abstract']
You can create a model registry to store, share, version, deploy, and track your models.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the administrator group (for example, {odh-admin-group}). If you are not using specialized groups, you are part of the {openshift-platform} administrator group.
* A cluster administrator has configured and enabled the model registry component in your {productname-short} deployment. For more information on configuring the model registry component, see link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-model-registries/#configuring-the-model-registry-component[Configuring the model registry component].
endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the administrator group (for example, {oai-admin-group}). If you are not using specialized groups, you are part of the {openshift-platform} administrator group. For more information, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/installing_and_uninstalling_{url-productname-short}/installing-and-deploying-openshift-ai_install#adding-administrative-users-in-{openshift-platform-url}_install[Adding administrative users in {openshift-platform}].
* A cluster administrator has configured and enabled the model registry component in your {productname-short} deployment.

* The model registry component is enabled for your {productname-short} deployment.
* You have access to an external MySQL database which uses at least MySQL version 5.x. However, {org-name} recommends that you use MySQL version 8.x.
