= Creating a model registry

[role='_abstract']
You can create a model registry to store, share, version, deploy, and track your models.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-short} as a user with {productname-short} administrator privileges. 
ifdef::upstream[]
* The model registry component is enabled in your {productname-short} deployment. For more information, see link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-model-registries/#enabling-the-model-registry-component_model-registry[Enabling the model registry component].
endif::[]
ifdef::self-managed[]
* The model registry component is enabled in your {productname-short} deployment. For more information, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/enabling_the_model_registry_component[Enabling the model registry component].
endif::[]
* You have access to an external MySQL database which uses at least MySQL version 5.x. However, {org-name} recommends that you use MySQL version 8.x.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Settings* -> *Model registry settings*.
. Click *Create model registry*.
+
The *Create model registry* dialog opens.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the model registry.
. Optional: Click *Edit resource name*, and then enter a specific resource name for the model registry in the *Resource name* field. By default, the resource name will match the name of the model registry.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Resource names are what your resources are labeled as in OpenShift. Your resource name cannot exceed 253 characters, must consist of lowercase alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character. Resource names are not editable after creation.

The resource name must not match the name of any other model registry resource in your OpenShift cluster.
====
. Optional: In the *Description* field, enter a description for the model registry.
. In the *Connect to external MySQL database* section, enter the information for the external database where your model data is stored.
.. In the *Host* field, enter the database hostname.
ifdef::upstream[]
... If the database is running in the `pass:attributes[{mr-default-namespace}]` namespace, enter only the hostname for the database.
... If the database is running in a different namespace from `pass:attributes[{mr-default-namespace}]`, enter the database hostname details in `<hostname>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local` format.
endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
... If the database is running in the `pass:attributes[{mr-default-namespace}]` namespace, enter only the hostname for the database.
... If the database is running in a different namespace from `pass:attributes[{mr-default-namespace}]`, enter the database hostname details in `<hostname>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local` format.
endif::[]
.. In the *Port* field, enter the port number for the database.
.. In the *Username* field, enter the default user name that is connected to the database.
.. In the *Password* field, enter the password for the default user account.
.. In the *Database* field, enter the database name.
. Optional: Select the *Add CA certificate to secure database connection* to use a certificate with your database connection.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If your external database is configured to enforce Transport Layer Security (TLS), then you must add a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate.
====
.. Click *Use cluster-wide CA bundle* to use the `ca-bundle.crt` bundle in the `odh-trusted-ca-bundle` ConfigMap.
.. Click *Use {productname-long} CA bundle* to use the `odh-ca-bundle.crt` bundle in the `odh-trusted-ca-bundle` ConfigMap.
ifdef::upstream[]
.. Click *Choose from existing certificates* to select an existing certificate. You can select the key of any ConfigMap or secret in the `pass:attributes[{mr-default-namespace}]` namespace.
endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
.. Click *Choose from existing certificates* to select an existing certificate. You can select the key of any ConfigMap or secret in the `pass:attributes[{mr-default-namespace}]` namespace.
endif::[]
... From the *Resource* list, select a ConfigMap or secret. 
... From the *Key* list, select a key.
.. Click *Upload new certificate* to upload a new certificate as a ConfigMap.
... Drag and drop the PEM file for your certificate into the *Certificate* field, or click *Upload* to select a file from your local machine's file system.
+
[NOTE]
====
Uploading a certificate creates the `db-credential` ConfigMap with the `ca.crt` key. 

ifdef::upstream[]
To upload a certificate as a secret, you must create a secret in the {openshift-platform} `pass:attributes[{mr-default-namespace}]` namespace, and then select it as an existing certificate when you create your model registry.

.Verification
* The new model registry is displayed on the *Model registry settings* page.
* You can edit the model registry by clicking the action menu (*&#8942;*) beside it, and then clicking *Edit model registry*.

* You can register a model with the model registry from the *Model registry* tab. For more information about working with model registries, see link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-model-registries/#working-with-model-registries_model-registry[Working with model registries].
