* The model registry component is enabled for your {productname-short} deployment.

endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
... If the database is running in the `rhoai-model-registries` namespace, enter only the hostname for the database.
... If the database is running in a different namespace from `rhoai-model-registries`, enter the database hostname details in `<host name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local` format.
endif::[]
