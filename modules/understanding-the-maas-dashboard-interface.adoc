= Models-as-a-Service dashboard interface

[role="_abstract"]
The Models-as-a-Service dashboard interface displays available models and provides tools for generating authentication tokens to access those models.

To access the Models-as-a-Service interface, log in to the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Gen AI studio* in the left navigation menu, click *AI asset endpoints*, and click the *Models as a service* tab.

The Models as a service page displays a table with all model deployments published to MaaS. Each row shows:

Name::
The model deployment name. Models published to MaaS display a *MaaS* badge next to the name.

Status::
The current operational state of the model (Ready, Not ready, or Unknown).

Inference endpoint::
A *View* link that opens a dialog showing the MaaS route URL and token generation options.

Actions::
Options such as *Add to playground* for testing the model interactively.

To view your current service tier assignment and limits, click the *Tier information* link near the top of the Models as a service page. Review your tier details in the popup dialog: tier name, groups you belong to, priority level, and rate limits. Understanding your tier limits helps you plan your usage and avoid rate limit errors.
