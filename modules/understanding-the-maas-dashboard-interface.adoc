= Models-as-a-Service dashboard interface

[role="_abstract"]
The Models-as-a-Service dashboard interface displays available models and provides tools for generating authentication tokens to access those models.

== Accessing the interface

To access the Models-as-a-Service interface:

. Log in to the {productname-short} dashboard.
. In the left navigation menu, click *Gen AI studio*.
. Click *AI asset endpoints*.
. Click the *Models as a service* tab.

== Understanding the models table

The Models as a service page displays a table with all model deployments published to MaaS. Each row shows:

Name::
The model deployment name. Models published to MaaS display a *MaaS* badge next to the name.

Status::
The current operational state of the model (Ready, Not ready, or Unknown).

Inference endpoint::
A *View* link that opens a dialog showing the MaaS route URL and token generation options.

Actions::
Options such as *Add to playground* for testing the model interactively.

== Viewing your tier information

To view your current service tier assignment and limits:

. Click the *Tier information* link near the top of the Models as a service page.
. Review your tier details in the popup dialog:
+
* Tier name (for example, Free, Premium, or Enterprise)
* Groups you belong to
* Priority level
* Rate limits (requests per time period and token quotas)

Understanding your tier limits helps you plan your usage and avoid rate limit errors.
