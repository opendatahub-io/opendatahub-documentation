[NOTE]
====
Do not delete all tiers from your system. If you delete the last remaining tier, the dashboard will not display the "Add tier" button, preventing you from creating new tiers through the UI. Ensure at least one tier remains in the system at all times.
====
[IMPORTANT]
====
Deleting a tier immediately affects all users assigned to it. Ensure that affected users are reassigned to another tier before deletion to avoid service disruption.
====

.Verification

* Verify that the tier no longer appears in the tiers list.
* Confirm that users who were in the deleted tier's groups are now assigned to a different tier based on their remaining group memberships.
