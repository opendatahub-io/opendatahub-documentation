= Using Ray directed acyclic graph node types in Feature Store

[role="_abstract"]
Use Ray directed acyclic graph (DAG) node types to build scalable, high-performance feature generation workflows. Ray optimizes resources and reduces execution time by handling data partitioning and statically allocating buffers. 

.Ray read node
.. Reads data from Ray-compatible sources:
* Supports Parquet, comma-separated values (CSV), and other formats
* Handles partitioning and schema inference
* Applies field mappings and filters

.Ray join node
.. Performs distributed joins:
* **Broadcast join**: Use for small datasets (&lt;100MB)
* **Distributed join**: Use for large datasets with time-based windowing
* **Automatic strategy selection:** Based on dataset size and cluster resources

.Ray filter node
.. Applies filters and time-based constraints:
* Time to leave (TTL)-based filtering
* Timestamp range filtering
* Custom predicate filtering

.Ray aggregation node
.. Handles feature aggregations:
* Windowed aggregations
* Grouped aggregations
* Custom aggregation functions

.Ray transformation node
.. Applies feature transformations:
* Row-level transformations
* Column-level transformations
* Custom transformation functions

.Ray write node
.. Writes results to various targets:
* Online stores
* Offline stores
* Temporary storage
