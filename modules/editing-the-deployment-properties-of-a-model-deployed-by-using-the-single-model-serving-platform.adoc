= Editing the deployment properties of a model deployed by using the single-model serving platform

[role='_abstract']
You can edit the deployment properties of a deployed model version from a model registry. For example, you can change the deployment name, model framework, number of model server replicas, model server size, and source model location details.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* An available model registry exists in your deployment, and contains at least 1 registered and deployed model version.
* You have access to the model registry that contains the model version deployment that you want to edit.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Models* -> *Model registry*.
. From the *Model registry* drop-down menu, select the model registry that contains the model deployment that you want to edit.
. In the *Model name* column, click the name of the model that contains the deployment that you want to edit.
+
The details page for the model opens.
. Click the name of the model version with the deployment that you want to edit.
. Click *Deployments*
. Click the action menu (*&#8942;*) beside the model deployment that you want to edit.
. Click *Edit*.
. In the *Edit model* dialog, edit the model deployment properties:
.. In the *Model deployment name* field, enter a new, unique name for your model deployment.
.. From the *Model framework* list, select a different framework for your model. 
+
NOTE: The *Model framework* list shows only the frameworks that are supported by the model serving runtime that you specified when you deployed your model.
+
.. In the *Number of model server replicas to deploy* field, specify a value.
.. From the *Model server size* list, select a value.
..  In the *Model route* section, select the *Make deployed models available through an external route* checkbox to make your deployed models available to external clients.
.. In the *Token authentication* section, select the *Require token authentication* checkbox to require token authentication for your model server. To finish configuring token authentication, perform the following actions:
... In the *Service account name* field, enter a service account name for which the token will be generated. The generated token is created and displayed in the *Token secret* field when the model server is configured.
... To add an additional service account, click *Add a service account* and enter another service account name.
.. Edit the connection by specifying an existing connection, or by creating a new connection. 
.. Customize the runtime parameters in the *Configuration parameters* section:
... Modify the values in *Additional serving runtime arguments* to define how the deployed model behaves.
... Modify the values in *Additional environment variables* to define variables in the model's environment.
+
The *Configuration parameters* section shows predefined serving runtime parameters, if any are available.
+
NOTE: Do not modify the port or model serving runtime arguments, because they require specific values to be set. Overwriting these parameters can cause the deployment to fail.
.. Click *Redeploy*.			 

.Verification
* The model redeploys and appears with updated details on the *Deployments* tab for the model version.
