To deploy the models for this tutorial, run the following commands from the directory containing the downloaded tutorial files (`odh-trustyai-demos-main`).

. Navigate to the `model-namespace` project you created:
+
[source]
----
oc project model-namespace
----

. Deploy the model's storage container:
+
[source]
----
oc apply -f 2-BiasMonitoring/resources/model_storage_container.yaml
----

. Deploy the OVMS 1.x serving runtime: 
+
[source]
----
oc apply -f 2-BiasMonitoring/resources/ovms-1.x.yaml
----

. Deploy the first model: 
+
[source]
----
oc apply -f 2-BiasMonitoring/resources/model_alpha.yaml
----

. Deploy the second model: 
+
[source]
----
oc apply -f 2-BiasMonitoring/resources/model_beta.yaml
----

.Verification

. In the {openshift-platform} console, click *Workloads* â†’ *Pods*.
. Confirm that there are four pods:
+
* `minio`
* `modelmesh-serving-ovms-1.x-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx`
* `modelmesh-serving-ovms-1.x-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx`
* `trustyai-service-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx`
+
When the TrustyAI service has registered the deployed models, the  `modelmesh-serving-ovms-1.x-xxxxx` pods are redeployed.

. To verify that TrustyAI has registered the models:
.. Select one of the `modelmesh-serving-ovms-1.x-xxxxx` pods. 
.. Click the *Environment* tab and confirm that the `MM_PAYLOAD_PROCESSORS` field is set.
