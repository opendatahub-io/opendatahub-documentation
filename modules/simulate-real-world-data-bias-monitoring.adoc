= Simulating real world data
Now that we've got our metric monitoring set up, let's send some "real world" data through our models to see if they remain fair:

[source]
for batch in "01" "02" "03" "04" "05" "06" "07" "08"; do
  scripts/send_data_batch data/batch_$batch.json
  sleep 5
done

Once the data is being sent, return to Observe -> Metrics page and watch the SPD and Identity metric values change.
