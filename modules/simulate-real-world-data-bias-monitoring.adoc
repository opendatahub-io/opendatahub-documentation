[id="simulate-real-world-data-bias-monitoring_{context}"]
= Simulating real world data

Now that you've set up metric monitoring set up, try sending some "real world" data through your models to see if they remain fair:

[source]
----
for batch in "01" "02" "03" "04" "05" "06" "07" "08"; do
  ./2-BiasMonitoring/scripts/send_data_batch 2-BiasMonitoring/data/batch_$batch.json
  sleep 5
done
----

Once the data is being sent, return to *Observe* -> *Metrics* page and watch the SPD and Identity metric values change.
