* You have been assigned the `monitoring-rules-view` role. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/monitoring/enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects#granting-users-permission-to-configure-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects_enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects[Granting users permission to configure monitoring for user-defined projects^].
