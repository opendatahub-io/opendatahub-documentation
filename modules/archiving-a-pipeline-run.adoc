= Archiving a pipeline run

[role='_abstract']
You can retain records of your pipeline runs by archiving them. If required, you can restore runs from your archive to reuse, or delete runs that are no longer required.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group} ) in OpenShift.
endif::[]

* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.

* You have previously created a data science project that is available and has a pipeline server.
* You have imported a pipeline to an active pipeline server.
* You have previously executed a pipeline run that is available. 

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Experiments* -> *Experiments and runs*.
. On the *Experiments* page, from the *Project* drop-down list, select the project that contains the pipeline experiment for the run that you want to archive.
. From the list of pipeline experiments, click the experiment that contains the pipeline run that you want to archive. 
+
The *Runs* page opens.
. On the *Runs* tab, click the action menu (*&#8942;*) beside the pipeline run that you want to archive, and then click *Archive*.
. In the *Archiving run* dialog, enter the run name in the text field to confirm that you intend to archive it.
