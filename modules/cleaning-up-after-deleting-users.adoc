After you remove a user's access to {productname-long} or Jupyter, you must also delete the configuration files for the user from {openshift-platform}.

After you remove a user's access to {productname-long} or Jupyter, you must also delete the configuration files for the user from OpenShift.
endif::[]
{org-name} recommends that you back up the user's data before removing their configuration files.

.Prerequisites

* (Optional) If you want to completely remove the user's access to {productname-short}, you have removed their credentials from your identity provider.
* You have revoked the user's access to Jupyter.

ifdef::cloud-service[]
* You have backed up the user's storage data from Amazon EBS or Google Persistent Disk.
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the administrator group (for example, {oai-admin-group}). If you are not using groups, you are part of the OpenShift Dedicated or Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) administrator group. For more information, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/installing_and_uninstalling_{url-productname-short}/installing-and-deploying-openshift-ai_install#adding-administrative-users-in-openshift_install[Adding administrative users in {openshift-platform}].
endif::[]

ifdef::self-managed[]
* You have backed up the user's storage data.
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the administrator group (for example, {oai-admin-group}). If you are not using groups, you are part of the {openshift-platform} administrator group. For more information, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/installing_and_uninstalling_{url-productname-short}/installing-and-deploying-openshift-ai_install#adding-administrative-users-in-openshift_install[Adding administrative users in {openshift-platform}].

* You have logged in to the {openshift-platform} web console.

* You have logged in to {productname-short}.

// TODO: When RHOAIENG-1137 is corrected, change to:
//* The user is not visible in the Jupyter administration interface.
* The user cannot access Jupyter any more, and sees an "Access permission needed" message if they try.
