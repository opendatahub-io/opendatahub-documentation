After you remove a user's access to {productname-long} or workbenches, you must also delete the configuration files for the user from OpenShift.
endif::[]
{org-name} recommends that you back up the user's data before removing their configuration files.

.Prerequisites

* (Optional) If you want to completely remove the user's access to {productname-short}, you have removed their credentials from your identity provider.
* You have revoked the user's access to workbenches.

ifdef::cloud-service[]
* You have backed up the user's storage data from Amazon EBS or Google Persistent Disk.
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the administrator group (for example, {oai-admin-group}). If you are not using specialized groups, you are part of the OpenShift Dedicated or Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) administrator group.
