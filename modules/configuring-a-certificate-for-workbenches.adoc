= Configuring a certificate for workbenches

[IMPORTANT]
====
Self-signed certificates apply by default to workbenches that you create after configuring cluster-wide certificates. To apply cluster-wide certificates to an existing workbench, stop and then restart the workbench.
====

Self-signed certificates are stored in `/etc/pki/tls/custom-certs/ca-bundle.crt`. Workbenches are preset with an environment variable that points packages to this path, and that covers many popular HTTP client packages. For packages that are not included by default, you can provide this certificate path. For example, for the `kfp` package to connect to the data science pipeline server:

[source]
----
from kfp.client import Client

with open(sa_token_file_path, 'r') as token_file:
    bearer_token = token_file.read()
    
    client = Client(
        host='https://<GO_TO_ROUTER_OF_DS_PROJECT>/',
        existing_token=bearer_token,
        ssl_ca_cert='/etc/pki/tls/custom-certs/ca-bundle.crt'
    )
    print(client.list_experiments())
