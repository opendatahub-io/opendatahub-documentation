= Feature Store apply command

[role='_abstract']
The `feast apply` command updates a Feature Store deployment to match the feature definitions in the feature repository.

The command performs the following actions:

* *Scans definitions*
+
Scans the Python files in the feature repository to identify Feature Store object definitions.This includes feature views, entities, and data sources.

* *Validates definitions*
+
Validates feature definitions to ensure accuracy.

* *Synchronizes metadata*
+
Synchronizes the metadata of Feature Store objects in the registry. If a registry does not exist, the Feature Store creates one. The standard registry is a `protobuf` binary file stored on a disk, either locally or in an object store.

* *Provisions infrastructure*
+
Creates the necessary Feature Store infrastructure. The deployed infrastructure depends on the provider configuration specified in the `feature_store.yaml` file:
+
** *Local provider*: Creates a SQLite online store.
** *Cloud provider*: Creates cloud infrastructure for services such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Amazon Web Services (AWS).
+
[NOTE]
====
Creating cloud infrastructure might incur costs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `feast apply` command registers or updates only objects found in your Python files. It does not delete objects that you remove from your code. To delete objects from the registry, use the `feast delete` command or the explicit delete methods available in the Python SDK.
