= Configuring a recommended accelerator for serving runtimes

[role='_abstract']
To help you indicate the most suitable accelerators to your data scientists, you can configure a recommended accelerator tag for your serving runtimes. 

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-short} as a user with {productname-short} administrator privileges. 

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Settings* > *Serving runtimes*.
+
The *Serving runtimes* page opens and shows the model-serving runtimes that are already installed and enabled in your {productname-short} deployment. By default, the OpenVINO Model Server runtime is pre-installed and enabled in {productname-short}.
. Edit your custom runtime that you want to add the recommended accelerator tag to, click the action menu (&#8942;) and select *Edit*.
+ 
A page with an embedded YAML editor opens.
+
NOTE: You cannot directly edit the OpenVINO Model Server runtime that is included in {productname-short} by default. However, you can _clone_ this runtime and edit the cloned version. You can then add the edited clone as a new, custom runtime. To do this, click the action menu beside the OpenVINO Model Server and select *Duplicate*.

. In the editor, enter the YAML code to apply the annotation `opendatahub.io/recommended-accelerators`. The excerpt in this example shows the annotation to set a recommended tag for an NVIDIA GPU accelerator:
+
[source,yaml]
metadata:
	annotations:
		opendatahub.io/recommended-accelerators: '["nvidia.com/gpu"]'
. Click *Update*.

.Verification
* When your data scientists select an accelerator with a specific serving runtime, a tag appears next to the corresponding accelerator indicating its compatibility.
