= Requesting a SHAP explanation

[role='_abstract']
To understand how a model makes its predictions and decisions, you can use a _SHapley Additive exPlanations_ (SHAP) explainer. SHAP explains a model's decision by showing a detailed breakdown of each feature's actual contribution to the final outcome. For example, in a model that predicts the price of a house, SHAP provides a list of how much each feature contributed (in actual monetary value) to the final price.

//You can request a SHAP explanation by using the {productname-short} dashboard or by using the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI).
