[role="_abstract"]
When you have installed KServe, you can use the {productname-long} dashboard to enable the single-model serving platform. You can also use the dashboard to enable model-serving runtimes for the platform.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-short} as a user with {productname-short} administrator privileges.
* You have installed KServe.
* Your cluster administrator has _not_ edited the {productname-short} dashboard configuration to disable the ability to select the single-model serving platform, which uses the KServe component. For more information, see link:{rhoaidocshome}/html/managing_openshift_ai/customizing-the-dashboard#ref-dashboard-configuration-options_dashboard[Dashboard configuration options].

.. In the left menu, click *Settings* -> *Cluster settings*.
.. Locate the *Model serving platforms* section.
.. To enable the single-model serving platform for projects, select the *Single-model serving platform* checkbox.
.. Click *Save changes*.
. Enable preinstalled runtimes for the single-model serving platform as follows:
.. In the left menu of the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Settings* -> *Serving runtimes*. 
+
The *Serving runtimes* page shows preinstalled runtimes and any custom runtimes that you have added.
