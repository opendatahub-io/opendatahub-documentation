= Using Ray join strategies in Feature Store

[role="_abstract"]
The Ray compute engine automatically selects optimal join strategies:

.Using the broadcast join
..Used for small feature datasets:
* Selects this join automatically when feature data is &lt;100MB.
* Caches features in Ray's object store.
* Distributes entities across a cluster.
* Copies feature data and sends it to each worker.
* Uses the distributed window join.
* Used for large feature datasets.
* Selects this join automatically when feature data  &lt;100MB.
* Partitions data by time windows.
* Provides point-in-time joins within each window.
* Combines results across windows.

.Example of using strategy selection logic
