Technology Preview features are not supported with {org-name} production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete.
{org-name} does not recommend using them in production.
These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

A model registry is an important component in the lifecycle of an artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) model, and a vital part of any machine learning operations (MLOps) platform or ML workflow. A model registry acts as a central repository, holding metadata related to machine learning models from inception to deployment. This metadata ranges from high-level information like the deployment environment and project origins, to intricate details like training hyperparameters, performance metrics, and deployment events. A model registry acts as a bridge between model experimentation and serving, offering a secure, collaborative metadata store interface for stakeholders of the ML lifecycle.

Model registries provide a structured and organized way to store, share, version, deploy, and track models.

To use model registries in {productname-short}, an OpenShift cluster administrator must configure the model registry component in OpenShift. For more information, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/configuring_the_model_registry_component/configuring-the-model-registry-component_model-registry-config[Configuring the model registry component].

After the model registry component is configured, an {productname-short} administrator can create model registries in {productname-short} and grant model registry access to the data scientists that will work with them. For more information, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/managing_model_registries/index[Managing model registries].

Data scientists with access to a model registry can store, share, version, deploy, and track models using the model registry feature. For more information, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_model_registries/index[Working with model registries].
