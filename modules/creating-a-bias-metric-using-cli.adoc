= Creating a bias metric by using the CLI

[role='_abstract']
You can use the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI) to create a bias metric for a model. 

.Prerequisites

ifndef::upstream[]
* You are familiar with link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/monitoring_data_science_models/monitoring-model-bias_bias-monitoring#supported-bias-metrics_bias-monitoring[the bias metrics that {productname-short} supports] and how to interpret them.
endif::[]

ifdef::upstream[]
* You are familiar with link:{odhdocshome}/monitoring-data-science-models/#supported-bias-metrics_bias-monitoring[the bias metrics that {productname-short} supports] and how to interpret them.
endif::[]

* You are familiar with the specific data set schema and understand the names and meanings of the inputs and outputs.

* Your OpenShift cluster administrator added you as a user to the {openshift-platform} cluster and has installed the TrustyAI service for the data science project that contains the deployed models.

ifdef::upstream[]
* You set up TrustyAI for your data science project, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/monitoring-data-science-models/#setting-up-trustyai-for-your-project_monitor[Setting up TrustyAI for your project].
endif::[]

.Procedure

. In a terminal window, log in to the OpenShift cluster where {productname-short} is deployed.
+
----
oc login
----

. Set the `TRUSTY_ROUTE` variable to the external route for the TrustyAI service pod.
+
----
TRUSTY_ROUTE=https://$(oc get route/trustyai-service --template={{.spec.host}})
----

.  Optionally, get the full list of TrustyAI service endpoints and payloads.
+
----
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" --location $TRUSTY_ROUTE/q/openapi
----

. Use `POST /metrics/group/fairness/spd/request` to schedule a recurring bias monitoring metric with the following syntax and payload structure:
+
*Syntax*:
+
----
curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X POST --location $TRUSTY_ROUTE/metrics/spd/request \
 --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data <payload>
----
+
*Payload structure*:

`modelId`:: The name of the model to query.
`protectedAttribute`:: The name of the feature that distinguishes the groups that you are checking for fairness.
`privilegedAttribute`:: The suspected favored (positively biased) class.
`unprivilegedAttribute`:: The suspected unfavored (negatively biased) class.
`outcomeName`:: The name of the output that provides the output you are examining for fairness.
`favorableOutcome`:: The value of the `outcomeName` output that describes the favorable or desired model prediction.
`batchSize`:: The number of previous inferences to include in the calculation.

For example:

----
curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X POST --location $TRUSTY_ROUTE/metrics/group/fairness/spd/ \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data "{
                 \"modelId\": \"demo-loan-nn-onnx-alpha\",
                 \"protectedAttribute\": \"Is Male-Identifying?\",
                 \"privilegedAttribute\": 1.0,
                 \"unprivilegedAttribute\": 0.0,
                 \"outcomeName\": \"Will Default?\",
                 \"favorableOutcome\": 0,
                 \"batchSize\": 5000
             }"
----

.Verification

The bias metrics request should return output similar to the following:

----
{
   "timestamp":"2023-10-24T12:06:04.586+00:00",
   "type":"metric",
   "value":-0.0029676404469311524,
   "namedValues":null,
   "specificDefinition":"The SPD of -0.002968 indicates that the likelihood of Group:Is Male-Identifying?=1.0 receiving Outcome:Will Default?=0 was -0.296764 percentage points lower than that of Group:Is Male-Identifying?=0.0.",
   "name":"SPD",
   "id":"d2707d5b-cae9-41aa-bcd3-d950176cbbaf",
   "thresholds":{"lowerBound":-0.1,"upperBound":0.1,"outsideBounds":false}
}
----

The `specificDefinition` field helps you understand the real-world interpretation of these metric values. For this example, the model is fair over the `Is Male-Identifying?` field, with the rate of positive outcome only differing by about -0.3%.
