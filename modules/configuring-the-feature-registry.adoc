= Configuring the feature registry

[role='_abstract']
By default, when you create a feature instance using the minimal configuration, the registry is a simple SQLite database.

The example in the following procedure shows how to configure an S3 registry.

You can configure other types of registries, such as GCS, SQL, Snowflake, as detailed in the link:https://docs.feast.dev/master/reference/registries[Feast reference documentation for registries^].

NOTE: The example code in the following procedure requires that you edit it with values that are specific to your use case.

.Prerequisites
* You have cluster administrator privileges for your {openshift-platform} cluster.

* You have enabled the Feature Store component, as described in _Enabling the Feature Store component_.

ifndef::upstream[]
* You have created a project, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_projects/using-projects_projects#creating-a-project_projects[Creating a project]. In the following procedure, `my-project` is the name of the project.
endif::[]

ifdef::upstream[]
* You have created a project, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working-on-projects/#creating-a-project_projects[Creating a project]. In the following procedure, `my-project` is the name of the project.
endif::[]

* Your project includes an existing secret that provides credentials for accessing the database that you want to use for the registry. The example in the following procedure requires that you have configured S3.

.Procedure

. Click *Create*.


.Verification

. In the {openshift-platform} console, select *Workloads* -> *Pods*.
. Make sure that your project (for example, `my-project`) is selected.
. Find the pod that has the `feast-` prefix, followed by the metadata name that you specified in the CRD configuration, for example, `sample-s3-registry`.
. Click the feast pod and then select *Pod details*. 
. Click *Terminal*.
. In the Terminal window, enter the following command to view the configuration, including the S3 registry:
