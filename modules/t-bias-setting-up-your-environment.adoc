= Setting up your environment

To set up your environment for this tutorial, complete the following tasks:

* Download tutorial files from the link:https://github.com/trustyai-explainability/odh-trustyai-demos/tree/main[trustyai-explainability^] repository.
* Log in to the OpenShift cluster from the command line.
* Configure monitoring for the model serving platform.
* Enable the TrustyAI component in the {productname-long} Operator.
* Set up a project.
* Authenticate the TrustyAI service.

.Prerequisites
* The {productname-long} Operator is installed on your {openshift-platform} cluster. 
* You have cluster administrator privileges for your {openshift-platform} cluster.
* You have downloaded and installed the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI). See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI^].

== Downloading the tutorial files

. Go to https://github.com/trustyai-explainability/odh-trustyai-demos/tree/main.
. Click the *Code* button and then click *Download ZIP* to download the repository.
. Extract the downloaded repository files.

== Logging in to the OpenShift cluster from the command line

. Obtain the command for logging in to the OpenShift cluster from the command line:
.. In the upper-right corner of the {openshift-platform} web console, click your user name and select *Copy login command*. 
.. Log in with your credentials and then click *Display token*.
.. Copy the *Log in with this token* command, which has the following syntax: 
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc login --token=__<token>__ --server=__<openshift_cluster_url>__
----
. In a terminal window, paste and run the login command.

== Configuring monitoring for the model serving platform

To enable monitoring on user-defined projects, you must configure monitoring for the model serving platform.

. Run the following command from the directory containing the downloaded tutorial files (`odh-trustyai-demos-main`):
+
[source]
----
oc apply -f 1-Installation/resources/enable_uwm.yaml
----

. To configure monitoring to store metric data for 15 days, run the following command from the directory containing the downloaded tutorial files (`odh-trustyai-demos-main`):
+
[source]
----
oc apply -f 1-Installation/resources/uwm_configmap.yaml
----

== Setting up a project

For this tutorial, you must create a project named `model-namespace`.

. To create a new project named `model-namespace`, run the following command from the directory containing the downloaded tutorial files (`odh-trustyai-demos-main`):
+
[source]
----
oc new-project model-namespace
----

. Prepare the `model-namespace` project for multi-model serving:
+
[source]
----
oc label namespace model-namespace "modelmesh-enabled=true" --overwrite=true
----

== Authenticating the TrustyAI service

TrustyAI endpoints are authenticated with a Bearer token. To obtain this token and set a variable (TOKEN) to use later, run the following command:

[source]
----
export TOKEN=$(oc whoami -t)
----
