= Prerequisites for installing MaaS

[role="_abstract"]
Before installing Models-as-a-Service, verify that your cluster has the required platform components, operators, and infrastructure resources.

[id="maas-dependencies_{context}"]
== MaaS dependencies

MaaS requires several platform components to function:

* *KServe* provides the underlying model serving infrastructure that hosts the large language models.
* *Kuadrant*, which includes Authorino and Limitador, enforces authentication, authorization, and rate limiting policies.
* *Gateway API* routes traffic to models and applies policy enforcement at the network level.
* *LeaderWorkerSet* enables multi-host inference for large models that require distributed serving.

== Requirements

Before you install MaaS, ensure that your environment meets the following requirements:

**Platform and access requirements:**

* You have a cluster with {openshift-platform} version 4.19 or later.
* You have cluster administrator access to install operators and create cluster-scoped resources.
* You have administrator access to the {productname-short} namespace to configure MaaS components.
* Your cluster has a functional ingress controller with valid TLS certificates for external access.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI, `oc`.

**Operator requirements:**

* You have installed the LeaderWorkerSet Operator and created the required API resources.
* You have installed the Red Hat Connectivity Link Operator v1.2 or later and created a `Kuadrant` custom resource in the `kuadrant-system` namespace with ready status.
* You have installed {productname-long} Operator v3.0 or later.

**Infrastructure requirements:**

* You have created a `DataScienceCluster` resource with the `kserve` component set to `Managed`.
* You have created the `openshift-ai-inference` Gateway in the `openshift-ingress` namespace.
* You have a `GatewayClass` resource configured for the OpenShift Gateway Controller: `openshift.io/gateway-controller`.

To verify that your environment meets these requirements:

. Check your OpenShift version:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc version
----

. Verify that you have cluster administrator access:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc auth can-i create clusterrole
----
+
.Example output
----
yes
----

. Verify that KServe is installed and managed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get datasciencecluster -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.components.kserve.managementState}'
----
+
.Example output
----
Managed
----

. Verify that Kuadrant is running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n kuadrant-system
----
+
.Example output
----

----

. Verify that the Gateway exists:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get gateway openshift-ai-inference -n openshift-ingress
----
+
.Example output
----

. Verify that LeaderWorkerSet API is available:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc api-resources | grep leaderworkerset
----
