= Testing with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

[role="_abstract"]
You can interact with your model in the playground, and also enhance your model's responses by providing it with contextual information from your own documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). You can upload documents to the vector database associated with the playground to provide context for your model's responses.
 
.Prerequisites

* You have configured your playground and connected it to a deployed model.
* You have the document files ready to upload.

.Procedure

. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Gen AI studio* -> *Playground*.
. In the *Playground* interface, click the toggle in the *RAG* section and then expand the section.
. Click *Upload*.
+
The *Upload files* dialog opens.
. Drag and drop your file or click to browse and select a file from your local system.
. Optional: Adjust the *Maximum chunk length* and *Chunk overlap* and *Delimiter* values as needed for your document type.
. Click *Upload*.
+
Wait for the file to finish processing. A *Source uploaded* notification appears, and the file is listed under *Uploaded files*.
. Repeat these steps to upload additional files if needed.
. In the chat input field, ask a question related to your documents that the model would not know otherwise.
. Observe the model's response.

.Verification

* The model retrieves information from the uploaded documents to answer the question.
