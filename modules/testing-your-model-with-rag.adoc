= Testing your model with retrieval augmented generation (RAG)

[role="_abstract"]
You can enhance your model's responses by providing it with contextual information from your own documents using retrieval augmented generation (RAG). You can upload documents to the vector database associated with the playground to provide context for your model's responses.

[IMPORTANT]
=====
The RAG feature of the gen AI playground is currently configured to work only with an inline vector database. There is currently no mechanism to configure the playground to connect this RAG feature to an external or remote vector database.
=====

.Prerequisites

* You have configured a playground for your project.
* You have the document files ready to upload. The supported file formats are PDF, DOC, or CSV. You can upload up to 10 files, with a maximum size of 10MB per file.

.Procedure

. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Gen AI studio* -> *Playground*.
. In the *Playground* interface, click the toggle in the *RAG* section and then expand the section.
. Click *Upload*.
+
The *Upload files* dialog opens.
. Drag and drop your file or click to browse and select a file from your local system.

. Optional: Adjust the *Maximum chunk length* and *Chunk overlap* and *Delimiter* values as needed for your document type. For more information about these settings, see link:{odhdocshome}/experimenting-with-models-in-the-gen-ai-playground/#testing-your-model-with-rag_rhoai-user[Understanding RAG settings].

endif::[]
. Click *Upload*.
+
Wait for the file to finish processing. A *Source uploaded* notification appears, and the file is listed under *Uploaded files*.
. Repeat these steps to upload additional files if needed.
. In the *System instructions* field, review or edit the text to define the context, persona, or instructions for the model. The playground provides a default prompt.
. In the chat input field, ask a question related to your documents that the model would not know otherwise.
. Observe the model's response.

[TIP]
====
If a model is reluctant to use the RAG feature (its knowledge search tool), you can modify the prompt in the *System instructions* field to explicitly guide its behavior.

You can refine the system prompt by including directives such as:

* **To force use:** "You **MUST** use the `knowledge_search` tool to obtain updated information."
* **To specify context:** "Always search the knowledge base before answering questions about company policies, recent events, or specific documentation."

This ensures the model actively utilizes the available RAG documents rather than relying solely on its pre-trained data.
====
+
*NOTE:* After you send a prompt, the *Send* button in the chat input field changes to a *Stop* button. Click it if you want to interrupt the model's response, for example, when the response takes longer than you anticipated or if you notice that you made an error in your prompt. The Bot posts “You stopped this message” to confirm your stop request.

. Optional. To clear the chat history and start a new conversation, click *New Chat*. The chat interface clears the chat history. Your playground configuration settings are preserved.

.Verification

* The model retrieves information from the uploaded documents to answer the question.
