|Description

|Configuration path
|The system mounts the necessary Feature Store client configuration files to the following location: `opt/app-root/src/feast-config/my_project.yaml` 

|Python instantiation
|Initialize the Feature Store with the path to the mounted configuration file:
`fs_obj = FeatureStore(fs_yaml_file='/usr/app-root/config/feast/my_project.yaml')`

Verify connection:
`fs_obj.list_feature_views()`

|Troubleshooting access
|If you cannot view a specific Feature Store in the workbench dropdown menu, an administrator must verify the following: 
* You have the correct access control based on your group/namespace access.
* Your authentication token is valid and permits viewing the specific config map associated with that Feature Store.
