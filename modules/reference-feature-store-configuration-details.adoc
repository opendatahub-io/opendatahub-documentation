|Configuration element
|Description

|Configuration path
|The system mounts the necessary Feature Store client configuration files to the following Feast configuration file:
`/opt/app-root/src/feast-config/my_project.yaml`

|Python instantiation
|Initialize Feature Store with the path to the mounted configuration file:
`fs_obj = FeatureStore(fs_yaml_file='/usr/app-root/config/feast/my_project.yaml')`

|Troubleshooting access
|If you cannot view a specific Feature Store in the workbench dropdown menu, an administrator must verify a couple items for you. They need to verify that you have the correct role-based access control (RBAC) based on your `group/namespace` access and that your authentication token is valid and permits viewing a specific config map associated with that Feature Store instance.
