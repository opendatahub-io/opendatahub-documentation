= Deploying a Grafana metrics dashboard

[role='_abstract']

You can deploy a Grafana metrics dashboard for User Workload Monitoring (UWM) to monitor performance and resource usage metrics for models deployed on the single-model serving platform. 

You can create a Kustomize overlay, similar to link:https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/rhoai-uwm/tree/main/rhoai-uwm-grafana/overlays/rhoai-uwm-user-grafana-app[this example]. Use the overlay to deploy preconfigured metrics dashboards for models deployed with OpenVino Model Server (OVMS) and vLLM.

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster admin privileges for your OpenShift cluster.
ifdef::upstream[]
* A cluster admin has enabled user workload monitoring (UWM) for user-defined projects on your OpenShift cluster. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/monitoring/configuring-user-workload-monitoring#enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects-uwm_preparing-to-configure-the-monitoring-stack-uwm[Enabling monitoring for user-defined projects] and link:{odhdocshome}/managing-and-monitoring-models/#configuring-monitoring-for-the-single-model-serving-platform_cluster-admin[Configuring monitoring for the single-model serving platform].

endif::[]
ifdef::self-managed[]
* You have installed the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI). For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI^].

* You have installed the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI). For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_dedicated/{osd-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI (OpenShift Dedicated)^] or link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/{rosa-latest-version}/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI (Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS)^].
endif::[]
* You have created an overlay to deploy a Grafana instance, similar to link:https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/rhoai-uwm/tree/main/rhoai-uwm-grafana/overlays/rhoai-uwm-user-grafana-app[this example].
** For vLLM deployments, see examples in link:https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/examples/online_serving/dashboards.html[Monitoring Dashboards].

[NOTE]
====
To view GPU metrics, you must enable the NVIDIA GPU monitoring dashboard as described in link:https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/openshift/24.9.2/enable-gpu-monitoring-dashboard.html[Enabling the GPU monitoring dashboard]. The GPU monitoring dashboard provides a comprehensive view of GPU utilization, memory usage, and other metrics for your GPU nodes.
====

.Procedure

. In a terminal window, log in to the OpenShift CLI as a cluster administrator.
. If you have not already created the overlay to install the Grafana operator and metrics dashboards, refer to the link:https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/rhoai-uwm/tree/main/rhoai-uwm-grafana/overlays/rhoai-uwm-user-grafana-app[RHOAI UWM repository] to create it.
. Install the Grafana instance and metrics dashboards on your OpenShift cluster with the overlay that you created. Replace `<overlay-name>` with the name of your overlay.
+
[source]
----
oc apply -k overlays/<overlay-name>
----
. Retrieve the URL of the Grafana instance. Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace that contains the Grafana instance.
+
[source]
----
oc get route -n <namespace> grafana-route -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'
----
+
. Use the URL to access the Grafana instance:
+
[source]
----
grafana-<namespace>.apps.example-openshift.com
----

.Verification

* You can access the preconfigured dashboards available for KServe, vLLM and OVMS on the Grafana instance.
