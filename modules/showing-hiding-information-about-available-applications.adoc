= Showing or hiding information about available applications

[role='_abstract']
You can view a list of available applications in the *Exploring applications* page of the {productname-short} dashboard. By default, the following information is provided for each application:

* Any independent software vendor (ISV) application is indicated with a label on the tile indicating `pass:attributes[{org-name}]-managed`, `Partner managed`, or `Self-managed`. As an {productname-short} administrator, you can hide or show the labels. For example, if you are running a self-managed environment, you might want to show all available applications regardless of the support level. 

* When a user clicks on an application, an information panel is displayed and provides more information about the application, including links to quick starts or detailed documentation. You can disable or enable the appearance of application information panels.

.Prerequisites

* You have {productname-short} administrator privileges.
