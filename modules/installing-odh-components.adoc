= Installing Open Data Hub components

[role='_abstract']
You can use the OpenShift web console to install specific components of Open Data Hub on your cluster when the Open Data Hub Operator is already installed on the cluster.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the Open Data Hub Operator.
* You can log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you want to use the `trustyai` component, you must enable user workload monitoring as described in link:{odhdocshome}/monitoring-data-science-models/#configuring-monitoring-for-the-multi-model-serving-platform_monitor[Configuring monitoring for the multi-model serving platform].
endif::[]
* If you want to use the `kserve` or `modelmesh` components, you must have already installed the following Operator or Operators for the component. For information about installing an Operator, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/operators/administrator-tasks#olm-adding-operators-to-a-cluster[Adding Operators to a cluster].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The multi-model serving platform based on ModelMesh is deprecated. 
You can continue to deploy models on the multi-model serving platform, but it is recommended that you migrate to the single-model serving platform.

* If you want to use `kserve`, you have selected a deployment mode. For more information, see link:{odhdocshome}serving-models/#about-kserve-deployment-modes_serving-large-models[About KServe deployment modes].

.Procedure
. Log in to your {openshift-platform} as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges. If you are performing a developer installation on link:http://try.openshift.com[try.openshift.com], you can log in as the `kubeadmin` user.
. Select *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*, and then click the *Open Data Hub Operator*.
. On the *Operator details* page, click the *DSC Initialization* tab, and then click *Create DSCInitialization*.
. On the *Create DSCInitialization* page, configure by using *Form* view or *YAML* view. For general information about the supported components, see link:https://opendatahub.io/docs/tiered-components[Tiered Components].
* Configure by using *Form* view:
.. In the *Name* field, enter a value.
.. If you are using a custom applications namespace, enter the namespace in the *Applications Namespace* field.
.. In the *Components* section, expand each component and set the *managementState* to *Managed* or *Removed*.
* Configure by using *YAML* view:
.. If you are using a custom applications namespace, specify the namespace in the `spec.applicationsNamespace` field.
.. In the `spec.components` section, for each component shown, set the value of the `managementState` field to either `Managed` or `Removed`.
. Click *Create*.
. Wait until the status of the DSCInitialization is *Ready*.
. Click the *Data Science Cluster* tab, and then click *Create DataScienceCluster*.
. On the *Create DataScienceCluster* page, configure the DataScienceCluster by using *Form* view or *YAML* view. For general information about the supported components, see link:https://opendatahub.io/docs/tiered-components[Tiered Components].
* Configure by using *Form* view:
.. In the *Name* field, enter a value.
.. In the *Components* section, expand each component and set the *managementState* to *Managed* or *Removed*.
.. If you are using a custom workbench namespace, enter the namespace in the *workbenchNamespace* field.
* Configure by using *YAML* view:
.. In the `spec.components` section, for each component shown, set the value of the `managementState` field to either `Managed` or `Removed`.
.. If you are using a custom workbench namespace, specify the namespace in the `spec.workbenches.workbenchNamespace` field.
. Click *Create*.


.Verification
. Select *Home* -> *Projects*, and then select the *opendatahub* project.
. On the *Project details* page, click the *Workloads* tab and confirm that the Open Data Hub core components are running. For more information, see link:https://opendatahub.io/docs/tiered-components[Tiered Components].

*Note:* In the {productname-long} dashboard, users can view the list of the installed {productname-short} components, their corresponding source (upstream) components, and the versions of the installed components, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/installing-open-data-hub/#viewing-installed-components_get-started[Viewing installed {productname-short} components].
