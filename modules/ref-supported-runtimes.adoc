= Supported model-serving runtimes

[role='_abstract']
{productname-short} includes several preinstalled model-serving runtimes. You can use preinstalled model-serving runtimes to start serving models without modifying or defining the runtime yourself. You can also add a custom runtime to support a model.

. The composite Caikit-TGIS runtime is based on link:https://github.com/opendatahub-io/caikit[Caikit^] and link:https://github.com/IBM/text-generation-inference[Text Generation Inference Server (TGIS)^]. To use this runtime, you must convert your models to Caikit format. For an example, see link:https://github.com/opendatahub-io/caikit-tgis-serving/blob/main/demo/kserve/built-tip.md#bootstrap-process[Converting Hugging Face Hub models to Caikit format^] in the link:https://github.com/opendatahub-io/caikit-tgis-serving/tree/main[caikit-tgis-serving^] repository.

. The Caikit Standalone runtime is based on link:https://github.com/caikit/caikit-nlp/tree/main[Caikit NLP^]. To use this runtime, you must convert your models to the Caikit embeddings format. For an example, see link:https://github.com/caikit/caikit-nlp/blob/main/tests/modules/text_embedding/test_embedding.py[Tests for text embedding module^].

. link:https://github.com/IBM/text-generation-inference[Text Generation Inference Server (TGIS)^] is based on an early fork of link:https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference[Hugging Face TGI^]. {org-name} will continue to develop the standalone TGIS runtime to support TGI models. If a model is incompatible in the current version of {productname-short}, support might be added in a future version. In the meantime, you can also add your own custom runtime to support a TGI model. For more information, see link:{odhdocshome}/serving-models/#adding-a-custom-model-serving-runtime-for-the-single-model-serving-platform_serving-large-models[Adding a custom model-serving runtime for the single-model serving platform].
