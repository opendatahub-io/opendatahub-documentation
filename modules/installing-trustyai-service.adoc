= Installing the TrustyAI service for a data science project

[role='_abstract']

Install TrustyAI into your project and provides access to its features for all models deployed within that project so that data scientists can monitor models. An instance of the TrustyAI service is required for each data science project, or namespace, that contains models that your team wants to monitor. 

ifdef::upstream[]
Use the {productname-short} dashboard or the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI) to install an instance of the TrustyAI service.
endif::[]

[NOTE]
====
Install only one instance of the TrustyAI service in a project. Multiple instances in the same project can result in unexpected behavior.
