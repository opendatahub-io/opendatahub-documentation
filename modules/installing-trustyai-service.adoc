= Installing the TrustyAI service for a project

[role='_abstract']

Install the TrustyAI service on a project to provide access to its features for all models deployed within that project. An instance of the TrustyAI service is required for each project, or namespace, that contains models that the data scientists want to monitor.

ifdef::upstream[]
Use the {productname-short} dashboard or the {openshift-cli} to install an instance of the TrustyAI service.
endif::[]

[NOTE]
====
Install only one instance of the TrustyAI service in a project. Multiple instances in the same project can result in unexpected behavior.

Installing TrustyAI into a namespace where non-OVMS models are deployed can cause errors in the TrustyAI service.
