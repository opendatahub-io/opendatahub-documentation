= Test models in the playground

[role="_abstract"]
Use the built-in playground to test prompts and observe model responses without writing code.

.Procedure

. On the Models as a service page, locate the model you want to test.
. In the Actions column, click the menu and select *Add to playground*.
. In the playground interface, enter your prompt in the message field.
. Adjust parameters as needed:
+
*Temperature*: Controls randomness: 0.0 for deterministic responses, 1.0 for creative responses.
+
*Max tokens*: Maximum length of the response.
+
*Top P*: Nucleus sampling threshold.
. Click *Send*.
. Review the model's response.
. Experiment with different prompts and parameters to understand the model's behavior.

The playground is useful for:

* Testing prompt engineering strategies
* Comparing model responses
* Validating that a model is suitable for your use case before integrating it into your application
* Demonstrating model capabilities to stakeholders

.Verification

* Verify that the model responds to your prompts in the playground.
* Check that adjusting parameters like temperature and max tokens affects the model's responses as expected.
