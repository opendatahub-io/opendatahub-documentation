= Enforcing the local-queue labeling policy for all projects

[role='_abstract']
The local-queue labeling policy is enforced for all projects by default.

If the original `ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding` resource is edited, you can undo the edits and enforce the policy for all projects in either of the following ways:

* Delete the `kueue-validating-admission-policy-binding` resource.
The resource is automatically re-created with the default values. 
No other action is required.

* Edit the existing resource as described in this procedure.

.Verification 

. Create a project.
. In that project, try to create a Ray cluster.
+
The Validating Admission Policy rejects the request, and the Ray cluster is not created, because no local queue is configured.
. Create a local queue without the `default-queue` annotation.
. Try to create a Ray cluster, and specify the local-queue name in the `local_queue` field.
+
The Validating Admission Policy approves the request, and the Ray cluster is created.
. Try to create a Ray cluster without specifying a value in the `local_queue` field.
+
The Validating Admission Policy rejects the request, and the Ray cluster is not created, because a local queue is not specified and a default local queue is not configured.
. Edit the local queue to add the `kueue.x-k8s.io/default-queue: "true"` annotation, which configures that queue as the default local queue.
. Try to create a Ray cluster without specifying a value in the `local_queue` field.
+
The Validating Admission Policy approves the request, and the Ray cluster is created even though a local queue is not specified, because the default local queue is used.
