=  Estimate memory usage

To learn how to estimate the amount of memory you need for running and training a specific model, as well as whether your configured GPUs can support the mode, use the memory estimator.. The memory estimator currently supports only supervised fine tuning (SFT) and Orthogonal Subspace Fine Tuning (OSFT) algorithms. See the following example files in the link:https://github.com/Red-Hat-AI-Innovation-Team/training_hub/tree/main/src/training_hub/[Training Hub Git repository]:

* For the Memory Estimator API, see the `src/training_hub/profiling/memory_estimator.py` file.

* For an example notebook that uses the API, see `notebooks/memory_estimator_example.ipynb` file.
