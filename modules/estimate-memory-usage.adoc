=  Estimate memory usage

To learn how to estimate the amount of memory you need for running and training a specific model, as well as whether your configured GPUs can support the model, see the following information about the Memory Estimator:

* For the Memory Estimator API, see the `src/training_hub/profiling/memory_estimator.py`

* For an example notebook that used the API, see `notebooks/memory_estimator_example.ipynb`
