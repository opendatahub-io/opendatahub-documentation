= Adding a connection to your project

[role='_abstract']
You can enhance your project by adding a connection that contains the configuration parameters needed to connect to a data source or sink.

When you want to work with a very large data sets, you can store your data in an Open Container Initiative (OCI)-compliant registry, S3-compatible object storage bucket, or a URI-based repository, so that you do not fill up your local storage. You also have the option of associating the connection with an existing workbench that does not already have a connection.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
* You have created a project that you can add a connection to.
* You have access to S3-compatible object storage, URI-based repository, or OCI-compliant registry.
* If you intend to add the connection to an existing workbench, you have saved any data in the workbench to avoid losing work.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Projects*.
+
The *Projects* page opens.
. Click the name of the project that you want to add a connection to.
+
A project details page opens.
. Click the *Connections* tab.
. Click *Add connection*.
+
. In the *Add connection* modal, select a *Connection type*. The *OCI-compliant registry*, *S3 compatible object storage*, and *URI* options are pre-installed connection types. Additional options might be available if your {productname-short} administrator added them.
+
The *Add connection* form opens with fields specific to the connection type that you selected.

. Enter a unique name for the connection.
+
A resource name is generated based on the name of the connection. A resource name is the label for the underlying resource in OpenShift. 

. Optional: Edit the default resource name. Note that you cannot change the resource name after you create the connection.

. Optional: Provide a description of the connection.

. Complete the form depending on the connection type that you selected. For example:
.. If you selected *S3 compatible object storage* as the connection type, configure the connection details:
... In the *Access key* field, enter the access key ID for the S3-compatible object storage provider.
... In the *Secret key* field, enter the secret access key for the S3-compatible object storage account that you specified.
... In the *Endpoint* field, enter the endpoint of your S3-compatible object storage bucket.
+
NOTE: Make sure to use the appropriate endpoint format. Improper formatting might cause connection errors or restrict access to storage resources.

... In the *Region* field, enter the default region of your S3-compatible object storage account.
... In the *Bucket* field, enter the name of your S3-compatible object storage bucket.
... Click *Create*.
.. If you selected *URI* in the preceding step, in the *URI* field, enter the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).
.. If you selected *OCI-compliant registry* in the preceding step, in the *OCI storage location* field, enter the URI.
. Click *Add connection*.

.Verification
* The connection that you added is displayed on the *Connections* tab for the project.
