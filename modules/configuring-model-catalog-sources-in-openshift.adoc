= Configuring model catalog sources in OpenShift

[role='_abstract']
As an OpenShift cluster administrator, you can configure a custom model catalog source by adding an entry to the `model-catalog-sources` config map in OpenShift. This entry provides details such as the catalog name and the location of the catalog source file that specifies your model definitions.


.Prerequisites
* You are logged in to the OpenShift web console with cluster administrator privileges.
* You have created a catalog source file that specifies your model definitions. For an example catalog source file, see the 
link:https://github.com/opendatahub-io/model-registry/blob/main/manifests/kustomize/options/catalog/base/sample-catalog.yaml[sample-catalog.yaml] file from Kubeflow Model Registry.  

.Procedure
. In the OpenShift web console navigation menu, click *Home -> Projects*.
. In the *Name* text box, enter `rhoai-model-registries`.
. In the navigation menu, click *Workloads -> ConfigMaps*.
. Click the *model-catalog-sources* config map name.
. Click the *YAML* tab to view the contents of the config map `.yaml` file. 
. Find the `data: sources.yaml` section to add your custom catalog source. 
. Add a new entry under the `catalogs` field, for example: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
data:
  sources.yaml: |-
    catalogs:
    - name: Sample Catalog
      id: sample_custom_catalog
      type: yaml
      enabled: true
      properties:
        yamlCatalogPath: sample-catalog.yaml
      labels: 
      - Sample Catalog  
  sample-catalog.yaml: |-
    <contents of your catalog file>
----
+
The example adds the `sample-catalog.yaml` file in the same config map as a sibling of `sources.yaml` and references the sample catalog file in the `yamlCatalogPath` property. 
+
The new catalog source entry is described as follows:
+
* `name`: The user-friendly name of the catalog source.
* `id`: The unique ID of the catalog source.
* `type`: The catalog source type. The only supported type is `yaml`. 
* `enabled`: Whether the catalog source is enabled. Defaults to `true`.
* `properties.yamlCatalogPath`: The location of your catalog source file.
* `labels`: Optional labels for your catalog source to display in the catalog.

. Click *Save*.

.Verification
. In the OpenShift AI dashboard, click *AI hub -> Catalog*.
. In the menu bar, to view models from your new catalog source:
* If your catalog source has no label, click *Other models*.
* If your catalog source has a label, click *<your-label-name> models*.
+
NOTE: These changes might take a few minutes to be displayed in the catalog on the dashboard.
