[IMPORTANT]
====
While every effort is made to make {productname-long} resilient to OpenShift node failure, upgrades, and similarly disruptive operations, individual users' notebook environments can be interrupted during these events. If an OpenShift node restarts or becomes unavailable, any user notebook environment on that node is restarted on a different node. When this occurs, any ongoing process executing in the user's notebook environment is interrupted, and the user needs to re-execute it when their environment becomes available again.

Due to this limitation, {org-name} recommends that processes for which interruption is unacceptable are not executed in the Jupyter notebook server environment on {productname-short}.

| {org-name} OpenShift API Management
| OpenShift API Management is a service that accelerates time-to-value and reduces the cost of delivering API-first, microservices-based applications.
endif::[]

| OpenVINO
| OpenVINO is an open source toolkit to help optimize deep learning performance and deploy using an inference engine onto Intel hardware.

| Pachyderm
a| Use Pachyderm's data versioning, pipeline and lineage capabilities to automate the machine learning life cycle and optimize machine learning operations.

[NOTE]
====
The `pachd` pod that Pachyderm creates *intentionally* does not provide terminal access from the OpenShift web console. If you try to access the terminal view for the `pachd` pod, you see an error. This behavior is expected.

ifdef::self-managed[]
| Starburst Enterprise
| Starburst Enterprise platform (SEP) is the commercial distribution of Trino, which is an open-source, Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) ANSI SQL query engine. Starburst simplifies data access for your {productname-long} workloads by providing fast access to all of your data. Starburst does this by connecting directly to each data source and pulling the data back into memory for processing, alleviating the need to copy or move the data into a single location first.
