[id="configuring-a-training-job-by-using-the-kfto-sdk_{context}"]
= Configuring a training job by using the Training Operator SDK

[role='_abstract']
Before you can run a job to train a model, you must configure the training job.
You must set the training parameters, define the training function, and configure the Training Operator SDK.

[NOTE]
====
The code in this procedure specifies how to configure an example training job. 
If you have the specified resources, you can run the example code without editing it.

Alternatively, you can modify the example code to specify the appropriate configuration for your training job.
====

.Prerequisites

* You can access an OpenShift cluster that has sufficient worker nodes with supported accelerators to run your training or tuning job.

ifndef::upstream[]
* You can access a workbench that is suitable for distributed training, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_distributed_workloads/preparing-the-distributed-training-environment_distributed-workloads#creating-a-workbench-for-distributed-training_distributed-workloads[Creating a workbench for distributed training].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* You can access a workbench that is suitable for distributed training, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-distributed-workloads/#creating-a-workbench-for-distributed-training_distributed-workloads[Creating a workbench for distributed training].
endif::[]

* You have administrator access for the data science project.
** If you created the project, you automatically have administrator access. 
** If you did not create the project, your cluster administrator must give you administrator access.


.Procedure
. Open the workbench, as follows:
.. Log in to the {productname-long} web console.
.. Click *Data science projects* and click your project.
.. Click the *Workbenches* tab. 
.. If your workbench is not already running, start the workbench.
.. Click the *Open* link to open the IDE in a new window. 

. Click *File -> New -> Notebook*.

. Create the training function as shown in the following example:
.. Create a cell with the following content:
+
.Example training function
[source,subs="+quotes"]

def train_func():
    import os
    import torch
    import torch.distributed as dist

    # Select backend dynamically: 'nccl' for GPU, 'gloo' for CPU
    backend = "nccl" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "gloo"

    # Initialize the process group
    dist.init_process_group(backend)

    # Get rank and world size
    rank = dist.get_rank()
    world_size = dist.get_world_size()

    # Select device dynamically
    device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

    # Log rank initialization
    print(f"Rank {rank}/{world_size} initialized with backend '{backend}' on device {device}.")

    # Initialize tensor on the selected device
    tensor = torch.zeros(1, device=device)

    if rank == 0:
        tensor += 1
        for i in range(1, world_size):
            dist.send(tensor, dst=i)
    else:
        dist.recv(tensor, src=0)

    print(f"Rank {rank}: Tensor value {tensor.item()} on {device}")

    # Cleanup
    dist.destroy_process_group()

[NOTE]
====
For this example training job, you do not need to install any additional packages or set any training parameters.

.. Optional: Edit the content to specify the appropriate values for your environment.
.. Run the cell to create the training function.

. Configure the Training Operator SDK client authentication as follows:
.. Create a cell with the following content:

from kubernetes import client
from kubeflow.training import TrainingClient
from kubeflow.training.models import V1Volume, V1VolumeMount, V1PersistentVolumeClaimVolumeSource

api_server = "<API_SERVER>"
token = "<TOKEN>"

configuration = client.Configuration()
configuration.host = api_server
configuration.api_key = {"authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
# Un-comment if your cluster API server uses a self-signed certificate or an un-trusted CA
#configuration.verify_ssl = False
api_client = client.ApiClient(configuration)
client = TrainingClient(client_configuration=api_client.configuration)
----

.. Edit the `api_server` and `token` parameters to enter the values to authenticate to your OpenShift cluster.
