= Labeling data fields

As you can see, our models have not provided particularly useful field names for our inputs and outputs (all some form of `customer_data+input-x`). We can apply a set of name mappings to these to apply meaningful names to the fields. This is done via POST'ing the `/info/names` endpoint:

`./scripts/apply_name_mapping.sh`

Explore the link:https://github.com/trustyai-explainability/odh-trustyai-demos/blob/main/2-BiasMonitoring/scripts/apply_name_mapping.sh[apply_name_mapping.sh] script to understand how the payload is structured.
