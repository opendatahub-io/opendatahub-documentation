= Removing a CA bundle

[role='_abstract']
You can remove a Certificate Authority (CA) bundle from all non-reserved namespaces in {productname-short}. This process changes the default configuration and disables the creation of the `odh-trusted-ca-bundle` ConfigMap, as described in xref:understanding-certificates_certs[Understanding certificates in {productname-short}].

To remove a CA bundle from a single namespace only, see xref:removing-a-ca-bundle-from-a-namespace_certs[Removing a CA bundle from a namespace].

.Prerequisites
* You have cluster administrator privileges for your {openshift-platform} cluster.
* You installed the OpenShift command line interface (`oc`) as described in link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp-latest-version}/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[Get Started with the CLI].

.Procedure
. In the {openshift-platform} web console, click *Operators* â†’ *Installed Operators* and then click the {productname-long} Operator.
. Click the *DSC Initialization* tab.
. Click the *default-dsci* object.
. Click the *YAML* tab.
. In the `spec` section, change the value of the `managementState` field for `trustedCABundle` to `Removed`, as shown:
+
[source]
----
spec:
  trustedCABundle:
    managementState: Removed
----
NOTE: The `odh-trusted-ca-bundle` ConfigMaps are only deleted from namespaces when you set the `managementState` of `trustedCABundle` to `Removed`; deleting the DSC Initialization does not delete the ConfigMaps. 
. Click *Save*.

.Verification
* Run the following command to verify that the `odh-trusted-ca-bundle` ConfigMap has been removed from all namespaces:
+
[source]
----
$ oc get configmaps --all-namespaces | grep odh-trusted-ca-bundle
----
+
The command should not return any ConfigMaps.
