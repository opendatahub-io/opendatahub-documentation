= Using drift metrics


YOu can use the following data drift metrics in{productname-long}:

MeanShift::

The MeanShift metric calculates the per-column probability that the data values in a test data set are from the same distribution as those in a training data set (assuming that the values are normally distributed). This metric measures the difference in the means of specific features between the two datasets. 
+
MeanShift is useful for identifying straightforward changes in data distributions, such as when the entire distribution has shifted to the left or right along the feature axis.
+
This metric returns the probability that the distribution seen in the "real world" data is derived from the same distribution as the reference data. The closer the value is to 0, the more likely there is to be significant drift.

FourierMMD::

The FourierMMD metric provides the probability that the data values in a test data set have drifted from the training data set distribution, assuming that the computed Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) values are normally distributed. This metric compares the empirical distributions of the data sets by using an MMD measure in the Fourier domain. 
+
FourierMMD is useful for detecting subtle shifts in data distributions that might be overlooked by simpler statistical measures.
+
This metric returns the probability that the distribution seen in the "real world" data has drifted from the reference data. The closer the value is to 1, the more likely there is to be significant drift.

KSTest::

The KSTest metric calculates two Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for each column to determine whether the data sets are derived from the same distributions. This metric measures the maximum distance between the empirical cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the data sets, without assuming any specific underlying distribution.
+
KSTest is useful for detecting changes in distribution shape, location, and scale.
+
This metric returns the probability that the distribution seen in the "real world" data is derived from the same distribution as the reference data. The closer the value is to 0, the more likely there is to be significant drift.

ApproxKSTest::

The ApproxKSTest metric performs an approximate Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, ensuring that the maximum error is `6*epsilon` compared to an exact KSTest. 
+
ApproxKSTest is useful for detecting changes in distributions for large data sets where performing an exact KSTest might be computationally expensive.
+
This metric returns the probability that the distribution seen in the "real world" data is derived from the same distribution as the reference data. The closer the value is to 0, the more likely there is to be significant drift.
