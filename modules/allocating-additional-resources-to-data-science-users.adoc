= Allocating additional resources to {productname-short} users

[role='_abstract']
As a cluster administrator, you can allocate additional resources to a cluster to support compute-intensive data science work. This support includes increasing the number of nodes in the cluster and changing the cluster's allocated machine pool.

.Prerequisites
* You have credentials for administering clusters in OpenShift Cluster Manager (link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/[https://console.redhat.com/openshift/]). For more information about configuring administrative access in OpenShift Cluster Manager, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_cluster_manager/2023/html-single/managing_clusters/index#assembly-user-management-ocm[Configuring access to clusters in OpenShift Cluster Manager].
* If you want to increase the size of a machine pool by using accelerators, your {openshift-platform} cluster supports them.
* You have an AWS or GCP instance with the capacity to create larger container sizes. For compute-intensive operations, your AWS or GCP instance has enough capacity to accommodate the largest container size, `XL`.

.Procedure
. Log in to OpenShift Cluster Manager (link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/[https://console.redhat.com/openshift/]).
. Click *Clusters*.
+
The *Clusters* page opens.
. Click the name of the cluster you want to allocate additional resources to.
. Click *Actions* -> *Edit node count*.
. Select a *Machine pool* from the list.
. Select the number of nodes assigned to the machine pool from the *Node count* list.
. Click *Apply*.

.Verification
* The additional resources that you allocated to the cluster appear on the *Machine Pools* tab.
