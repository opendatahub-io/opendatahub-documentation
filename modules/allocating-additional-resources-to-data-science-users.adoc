= Allocating additional resources to {productname-short} users

[role='_abstract']
As a cluster administrator, you can allocate additional resources to a cluster to support compute-intensive data science work. This support includes increasing the number of nodes in the cluster and changing the cluster's allocated machine pool.

For more information about allocating additional resources to an {openshift-platform} cluster, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/machine_management/manually-scaling-machineset[Manually scaling a compute machine set].

.Prerequisites
* You have credentials for administering clusters in OpenShift Cluster Manager (link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/[https://console.redhat.com/openshift/]). For more information about configuring administrative access in OpenShift Cluster Manager, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_cluster_manager/1-latest/html/managing_clusters/assembly-user-management-ocm[Configuring access to clusters in OpenShift Cluster Manager].

* If you intend to increase the size of a machine pool by using accelerators, you have enabled GPU support in {productname-short}. This includes installing the Node Feature Discovery operator and NVIDIA GPU Operators. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/specialized_hardware_and_driver_enablement/psap-node-feature-discovery-operator#installing-the-node-feature-discovery-operator_psap-node-feature-discovery-operator[Installing the Node Feature Discovery operator^] and link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/managing_openshift_ai/enabling_accelerators#enabling-nvidia-gpus_managing-rhoai[Enabling NVIDIA GPUs^].

* If you intend to increase the size of a machine pool by using accelerators, you have enabled GPU support in {productname-short}. This includes installing the Node Feature Discovery and NVIDIA GPU Operators. For more information, see https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/openshift/latest/index.html[NVIDIA GPU Operator on {org-name} OpenShift Container Platform^] in the NVIDIA documentation. 
endif::[]
* You have an AWS or GCP instance with the capacity to create larger container sizes. For compute-intensive operations, your AWS or GCP instance has enough capacity to accommodate the largest container size, `XL`.

.Procedure
. Log in to OpenShift Cluster Manager (link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/[https://console.redhat.com/openshift/]).
. Click *Clusters*.
+
The *Clusters* page opens.
. Click the name of the cluster you want to allocate additional resources to.
. Click *Actions* -> *Edit node count*.
. Select a *Machine pool* from the list.
. Select the number of nodes assigned to the machine pool from the *Node count* list.
. Click *Apply*.

.Verification
* The additional resources that you allocated to the cluster appear on the *Machine Pools* tab.
