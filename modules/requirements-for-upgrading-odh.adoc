= Requirements for upgrading {productname-short}

[role="_abstract"]
This section describes the tasks that you should complete when upgrading {productname-short}.

*Check the components in the `DataScienceCluster` object*

When you upgrade to version {vernum}, the upgrade process automatically uses the values from the `DataScienceCluster` object in the previous version.

After the upgrade, you should inspect the {vernum} `DataScienceCluster` object and optionally update the status of any components as described in link:{odhdocshome}/upgrading-open-data-hub/#installing-odh-components_upgradev1[Installing Open Data Hub components].

*Recreate existing pipeline runs*

When you upgrade to version {vernum}, any existing pipeline runs that you created in version 1 continue to refer to the previous version's image (as expected).

You must delete the pipeline runs (not the pipelines) and create new pipeline runs. The pipeline runs that you create in version {vernum} correctly refer to the version {vernum} image.

For more information about pipeline runs, see link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-data-science-pipelines/#managing-pipeline-runs_ds-pipelines[Managing pipeline runs].

*Address KServe requirements*

For KServe (single-model serving platform), you must meet these requirements:

* Install dependent Operators, including the Red Hat OpenShift Serverless and Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operators. 
//For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_ai_self-managed/2-latest/html/working_on_data_science_projects/serving-large-models_serving-large-models[Serving large models].

* After the upgrade, you must inspect the default `DataScienceCluster` object and verify that the value of the  `managementState` field for the `kserve` component is `Managed`.

* In {productname-long} version 1, the KServe component is a Limited Availability feature. If you enabled the `kserve` component and created models in version 1, then after you upgrade to version {vernum}, you must update some {productname-short} resources as follows:

. Log in as an admin user to the {openshift-platform} cluster where {productname-short} {vernum} is installed:
+
----
$ oc login
----

. Update the *DSC Initialization* resource:
+
----
$ oc patch $(oc get dsci -A -oname) --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/serviceMesh/managementState", "value":"Unmanaged"}]'
----

. Update the *Data Science Cluster* resource:
+
----
$ oc patch $(oc get dsc -A -oname) --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/components/kserve/serving/managementState", "value":"Unmanaged"}]'
----

. Update the `InferenceServices` CRD:
+
----
$ oc patch crd inferenceservices.serving.kserve.io --type=json -p='[{"op": "remove", "path": "/spec/conversion"}]'
----

. Optionally, restart the Operator pod.
+ 

* If you deployed a model by using KServe in {productname-short} version 1, when you upgrade to version {vernum} the model does not automatically appear in the {productname-short} dashboard. To update the dashboard view, redeploy the model by using the {productname-short} dashboard.
