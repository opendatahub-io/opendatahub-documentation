= Using PVCs as storage

[role='_abstract']

To use a PVC as storage for the `LMEvalJob` results, you can use either managed PVCs or existing PVCs. Managed PVCs are managed by the TrustyAI operator. Existing PVCs are created by the end-user before the `LMEvalJob` is created.

[NOTE]
--
If both managed and existing PVCs are referenced in outputs, the TrustyAI operator defaults to the managed PVC.
--

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
* Your cluster administrator has installed {productname-short} and enabled the TrustyAI service for the data science project where the models are deployed.

== Managed PVCs

To create a managed PVC, specify its size. The managed PVC is named `<job-name>-pvc` and is available after the job finishes. When the `LMEvalJob` is deleted, the managed PVC is also deleted.

.Procedure
* Enter the following code:
+
[source]
----
apiVersion: trustyai.opendatahub.io/v1
kind: LMEvalJob
metadata:
  name: evaljob-sample
spec:
  # other fields omitted ...
  outputs: 
    pvcManaged: 
      size: 5Gi 
----

.Notes on the code
* `outputs` is the section for specifying custom storage locations
* `pvcManaged` will create an operator-managed PVC
* `size` (compatible with standard PVC syntax) is the only supported value

== Existing PVCs

To use an existing PVC, pass its name as a reference. The PVC must exist when you create the `LMEvalJob`. 
The PVC is not managed by the TrustyAI operator, so it is available after deleting the `LMEvalJob`.

.Procedure
. Create a PVC. An example is the following:
+
[source]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: "my-pvc"
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
----

. Reference the new PVC from the `LMEvalJob`.

kind: LMEvalJob
metadata:
  name: evaljob-sample
spec:
  # other fields omitted ...

    pvcName: "my-pvc"
