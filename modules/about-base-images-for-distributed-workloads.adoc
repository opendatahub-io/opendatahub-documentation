= About base images for distributed workloads

[role="_abstract"]
The base images for distributed workloads are optimized with the tools and libraries that you need to run distributed training jobs. 
You can use the provided base images or an {productname-short} admin user can create custom images adapted to your needs.

ifndef::upstream[]
For information about Red Hat support of distributed workload images and packages, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhoai-supported-configs[{productname-long}: Supported Configurations].
endif::[]

The following table lists the distributed workload images that are installed with {productname-long} by default.

If the preinstalled packages that are provided in these images are not sufficient for your use case, you have the following options:

* Install additional libraries after launching a default image. 
This option is good if you want to add libraries on an adÂ·hoc basis as you run training jobs. 
However, it can be challenging to manage the dependencies of installed libraries, and your changes are not saved when the workbench restarts.

* Create a custom image that includes the additional libraries or packages.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The ROCm-compatible Ray cluster image is Developer Preview software only. 
Developer Preview software is not supported by {org-name} in any way and is not functionally complete or production-ready. 
Do not use Developer Preview software for production or business-critical workloads. 
Developer Preview software provides early access to upcoming product software in advance of its possible inclusion in a {org-name} product offering. 
Customers can use this software to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process. 
This software might not have any documentation, is subject to change or removal at any time, and has received limited testing. 
{org-name} might provide ways to submit feedback on Developer Preview software without an associated SLA.
For more information about the support scope of {org-name} Developer Preview software, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/devpreview/[Developer Preview Support Scope].

| Image type | Description

| CUDA
| If you are working with compute-intensive data science models that require NVIDIA GPU support, use the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) base image to gain access to the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit. 
Using this toolkit, you can accelerate your work by using libraries and tools that are optimized for NVIDIA GPUs.

| If you are working with compute-intensive data science models that require AMD GPU support, use the ROCm base image to gain access to the AMD ROCm software stack. 
Using this software stack, you can accelerate your work by using libraries and tools that are optimized for AMD GPUs.
