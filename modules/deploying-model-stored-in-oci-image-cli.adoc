[id="deploying-model-stored-in-oci-image_{context}"]
= Deploying a model stored in an OCI image by using the CLI

[role='_abstract']

You can deploy a model that is stored in an OCI image from the command line interface.

The following procedure uses the example of deploying a MobileNet v2-7 model in ONNX format, stored in an OCI image on an OpenVINO model server.

[NOTE]
====
By default in KServe, models are exposed outside the cluster and not protected with authentication. 
====

.Prerequisites

ifndef::upstream[]
* You have stored a model in an OCI image as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/deploying_models/deploying-models_rhoai-user#storing-a-model-in-oci-image_rhoai-user[Storing a model in an OCI image].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* You have stored a model in an OCI image as described in link:{odhdocshome}/deploying-models/#storing-a-model-in-oci-image_odh-user[Storing a model in an OCI image].
endif::[]

* If you want to deploy a model that is stored in a private OCI repository, you must configure an image pull secret. For more information about creating an image pull secret, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/openshift_images/managing_images/using-image-pull-secrets.html[Using image pull secrets^].
* You are logged in to your OpenShift cluster.

.Procedure

. Create a project to deploy the model:
+
[source]
----
oc new-project oci-model-example
----
+

ifndef::upstream[]
. Use the {productname-short} Applications project `kserve-ovms` template to create a `ServingRuntime` resource and configure the OpenVINO model server in the new project:
+
[source, subs="attributes+"]
----
oc process -n {dbd-config-default-namespace} -o yaml kserve-ovms | oc apply -f -
----
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
. Use the {productname-short} project `kserve-ovms` template to create a `ServingRuntime` resource and configure the OpenVINO model server in the new project:
+
[source]
----
oc process -n opendatahub -o yaml kserve-ovms | oc apply -f -
----
endif::[]
+

. Verify that the `ServingRuntime` named `kserve-ovms` is created:
+
[source]
----
oc get servingruntimes
----
+
The command should return output similar to the following:
+
[source]
----
NAME          DISABLED   MODELTYPE     CONTAINERS         AGE
kserve-ovms              openvino_ir   kserve-container   1m
----
+
. Create an `InferenceService` YAML resource, depending on whether the model is stored from a private or a public OCI repository:
** For a model stored in a public OCI repository, create an `InferenceService` YAML file with the following values, replacing `<user_name>`, `<repository_name>`, and `<tag_name>` with values specific to your environment:
+
[source]
----
apiVersion: serving.kserve.io/v1beta1
kind: InferenceService
metadata:
  name: sample-isvc-using-oci
spec:
  predictor:
    model:
      runtime: kserve-ovms # Ensure this matches the name of the ServingRuntime resource
      modelFormat:
        name: onnx
      storageUri: oci://quay.io/<user_name>/<repository_name>:<tag_name>
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: 500Mi
          cpu: 100m
          # nvidia.com/gpu: "1" # Only required if you have GPUs available and the model and runtime will use it
        limits:
          memory: 4Gi
          cpu: 500m
          # nvidia.com/gpu: "1" # Only required if you have GPUs available and the model and runtime will use it
----
+

** For a model stored in a private OCI repository, create an `InferenceService` YAML file that specifies your pull secret in the `spec.predictor.imagePullSecrets` field, as shown in the following example:
+
[source]
----
apiVersion: serving.kserve.io/v1beta1
kind: InferenceService
metadata:
  name: sample-isvc-using-private-oci
spec:
  predictor:
    model:
      runtime: kserve-ovms # Ensure this matches the name of the ServingRuntime resource
      modelFormat:
        name: onnx
      storageUri: oci://quay.io/<user_name>/<repository_name>:<tag_name>
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: 500Mi
          cpu: 100m
          # nvidia.com/gpu: "1" # Only required if you have GPUs available and the model and runtime will use it
        limits:
          memory: 4Gi
          cpu: 500m
          # nvidia.com/gpu: "1" # Only required if you have GPUs available and the model and runtime will use it
    imagePullSecrets: # Specify image pull secrets to use for fetching container images, including OCI model images
    - name: <pull-secret-name>
----
+
After you create the `InferenceService` resource, KServe deploys the model stored in the OCI image referred to by the `storageUri` field. 


.Verification
Check the status of the deployment:

[source]
----
oc get inferenceservice
----

The command should return output that includes information, such as the URL of the deployed model and its readiness state.
