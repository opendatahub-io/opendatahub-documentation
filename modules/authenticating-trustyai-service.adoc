= Authenticating the TrustyAI service

[role='_abstract']
To access TrustyAI service external endpoints, you must provide OAuth proxy (oauth-proxy) authentication. You must obtain a user token, or a token from a service account with sufficient privileges, and then pass the token to the TrustyAI service when using `curl` commands.
