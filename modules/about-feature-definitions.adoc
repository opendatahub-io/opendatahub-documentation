= About feature definitions
 
A machine learning feature is a measurable property or attribute within a dataset that a machine learning model can analyze to learn patterns and make decisions. In Feature Store, you define a feature by defining the name and data type of an attribute. 

A feature definition is a schema that includes the name and data type of an attribute, as shown in the following example:

[source,python]
----
from feast import Field
from feast.types import Int64

credit_card_amount_due = Field(
    name="credit_card_amount_due",
    dtype=Int64
)
----

For a list of supported data types for fields in Feature Store, see the link::https://rtd.feast.dev/en/master/feast.html#module-feast.types[`feast.types` module] in the Feast documentation.

In addition to field name and data type, a feature view can include additional metadata associated, specified as descriptions of features, as shown in the following example:

[source,python]
----
from feast import Field
from feast.types import Int64


credit_card_amount_due = Field(
    name="credit_card_amount_due",
    dtype=Int64,
    description="Credit card amount due for user",
    tags={"team": "loan_department"},
)
