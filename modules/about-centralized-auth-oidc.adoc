= About centralized authentication Gateway API

A Gateway API with centralized authentication centralizes ingress traffic for all services behind a single domain, providing the following advanced capabilities:

* Centralized authentication: A single authentication service requiring only one client ID and secret from the external OIDC Identity Provider (IDP). 
* Simplified backend services: Backend services assume all incoming traffic is authenticated and contains necessary user headers. 
* Authorization handling: Services still handle authorization at the service or pod level using sidecars like `kube-rbac-proxy`.
* Encrypted Communication: Traffic from the gateway to the backend services is fully encrypted with Transport Layer Security (TLS). 

The Gateway API is implemented via an Istio Gateway on {openshift-platform} (OCP) 4.19 and later. Since the Istio Gateway is built on the Envoy Proxy, it provides access to powerful Envoy-specific Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), such as `EnvoyFilter`. The `opendatahub-operator` manages the deployment of `kube-auth-proxy`. The Operator then configures the Istio Gateway to use this service via an `EnvoyFilter` Custom Resource (CR).

For more information on supported OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers, see {openshift-platform} documentation on link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/authentication_and_authorization/external-auth#external-auth-providers_external-auth[Direct authentication identity providers]

== Security considerations
* Secret Management: Store OIDC client secrets securely and rotate them regularly.
* Network Policies: Consider implementing network policies to restrict access to the authentication proxy.
* TLS Configuration: Ensure all OIDC communication uses Transport Layer Security (TLS).
* Token Validation: While `kube-auth-proxy` validates tokens, ensure your OIDC provider is configured with appropriate token lifetimes.
* Audit Logging: Enable audit logging for authentication events.
