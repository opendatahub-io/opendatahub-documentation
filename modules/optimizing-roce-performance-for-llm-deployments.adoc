= Optimizing RoCE performance for LLM deployments

[role='_abstract']
Optimize your RoCE deployment for maximum performance with network tuning and model serving best practices.

== Network tuning

For optimal RoCE performance:

* Enable Priority Flow Control (PFC) on network switches to ensure lossless Ethernet traffic.
* Configure ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) for RoCE v2.
* Use dedicated VLANs for RDMA traffic to isolate from other workloads.
* Set the MTU size to 9000 bytes to enable jumbo frames.

== Model serving optimization

To optimize model serving:

* Use quantization. FP8 or INT8 quantization reduces memory usage and bandwidth requirements.
* Tune batch sizes. Larger batch sizes improve GPU utilization but increase latency.
