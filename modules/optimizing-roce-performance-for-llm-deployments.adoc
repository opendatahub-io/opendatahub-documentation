= Optimizing RoCE performance for LLM deployments

[role='_abstract']
Optimize your RoCE deployment for maximum performance with network tuning, NCCL configuration, and model serving best practices.

== Network tuning

For optimal RoCE performance:

* Enable Priority Flow Control (PFC) on network switches for lossless Ethernet
* Configure ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) for RoCE v2
* Use dedicated VLANs for RDMA traffic to isolate from other workloads
* Set appropriate MTU size, 9000 for jumbo frames

== Model serving optimization

* *Use quantization*: FP8 or INT8 quantization reduces memory usage and bandwidth requirements
* *Tune batch sizes*: Larger batch sizes improve GPU utilization but increase latency
