= Installing the TrustyAI service by using the dashboard

[role='_abstract']
You can use the {productname-short} dashboard to install an instance of the TrustyAI service.

.Prerequisites

* A cluster administrator has configured monitoring for the model serving platform, as described in xref:configuring-monitoring-for-the-multi-model-serving-platform_monitor[Configuring monitoring for the multi-model serving platform].

[NOTE]
====
Model monitoring with TrustyAI is only available on the ModelMesh-based _multi-model serving platform_. Model monitoring with TrustyAI is unavailable on the KServe-based _single-model serving platform_.
====

* A cluster administrator has enabled the TrustyAI component, as described in xref:enabling-trustyai-component_monitor[Enabling the TrustyAI component].

ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the administrator group (for example, {oai-admin-group}). If you are not using specialized groups, you are part of the {openshift-platform} administrator group.

* The data scientist has created a data science project, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/using-data-science-projects_projects#creating-a-data-science-project_projects[Creating a data science project], that contains the models that the data scientist wants to monitor.
endif::[]

ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the administrator group (for example, {odh-admin-group}). If you are not using specialized groups, you are part of the {openshift-platform} administrator group.

* The data scientist has created a data science project, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working-on-data-science-projects/#creating-a-data-science-project_projects[Creating a data science project], that contains the models that the data scientist wants to monitor.

. From the project list, select the project in which you installed TrustyAI.
. Confirm that the *Pods* list includes a running pod for the TrustyAI service. The pod has a naming pattern similar to the following example:
