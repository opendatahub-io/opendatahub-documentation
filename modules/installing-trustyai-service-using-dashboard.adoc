* A cluster administrator has enabled the TrustyAI component, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/monitoring-data-science-models/#enabling-trustyai-component_monitor[Enabling the TrustyAI component].

* If you are using TrustyAI with a database instead of PVC, a cluster administrator has configured TrustyAI to use the database, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/monitoring-data-science-models/#configuring-trustyai-with-a-database_monitor[Configuring TrustyAI with a database].

ifdef::cloud-service[]
. In the OpenShift web console, click *Workloads* → *Pods*.
endif::[]
. From the project list, select the project in which you installed TrustyAI.
. Confirm that the *Pods* list includes a running pod for the TrustyAI service. The pod has a naming pattern similar to the following example:
