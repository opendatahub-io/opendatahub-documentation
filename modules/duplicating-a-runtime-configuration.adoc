= Duplicating a runtime configuration

[role='_abstract']
To prevent you from re-creating runtime configurations with similar values in their entirety, you can duplicate an existing runtime configuration in the JupyterLab interface.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
* You have created a data science project that contains a workbench.
* You have created and configured a pipeline server within the data science project that contains your workbench.
* A previously created runtime configuration is visible in the JupyterLab interface.
* You have created and launched a workbench from a workbench image that contains the Elyra extension (Standard Data Science, TensorFlow, TrustyAI, ROCm-PyTorch, ROCm-TensorFlow, or PyTorch).

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Elyra pipeline editor is available in specific workbench images only. To use Elyra, the workbench must be based on a JupyterLab image. The Elyra extension is not available in code-server or RStudio IDEs. The workbench must also be derived from the Standard Data Science image. It is not available in Minimal Python or CUDA-based workbenches. All other supported JupyterLab-based workbench images have access to the Elyra extension.

.Procedure
. In the left sidebar of JupyterLab, click *Runtimes* (image:images/jupyter-runtimes-sidebar.png[The Runtimes icon]).
. Hover the cursor over the runtime configuration that you want to duplicate and click the *Duplicate* button (image:images/jupyterlab-duplicate.png[Duplicate]).

.Verification
* The runtime configuration that you duplicated is shown on the *Runtimes* tab (image:images/jupyter-runtimes-sidebar.png[The Runtimes icon]) in the left sidebar of JupyterLab.
