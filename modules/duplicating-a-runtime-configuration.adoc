= Duplicating a runtime configuration

[role='_abstract']
To prevent you from re-creating runtime configurations with similar values in their entirety, you can duplicate an existing runtime configuration in the JupyterLab interface.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group} ) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* You have created a data science project that contains a workbench.
* You have created and configured a pipeline server within the data science project that contains your workbench.
* A previously created runtime configuration is visible in the JupyterLab interface.
* You have created and launched a Jupyter server from a notebook image that contains the Elyra extension (Standard data science, TensorFlow, TrustyAI, PyTorch, or HabanaAI).

.Procedure
. In the left sidebar of JupyterLab, click *Runtimes* (image:images/jupyter-runtimes-sidebar.png[The Runtimes icon]).
. Hover the cursor over the runtime configuration that you want to duplicate and click the *Duplicate* button (image:images/jupyterlab-duplicate.png[Duplicate]).

.Verification
* The runtime configuration that you duplicated is shown on the *Runtimes* tab (image:images/jupyter-runtimes-sidebar.png[The Runtimes icon]) in the left sidebar of JupyterLab.
