The *AI asset endpoints page* is a central dashboard for managing the generative AI assets available for you to use within your project.


The page organizes assets into two categories:

* Models: Lists all generative AI models deployed in your project that have been designated as available assets. For a model to be available, you must select the *Add as AI asset endpoint* check box when deploying it.

The primary purpose of this page is to provide a starting point for using these assets. From here, you can perform actions such as adding a model to a playground instance for testing.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The assets listed on the *AI assets endpoints* page are scoped to your currently selected project. You only see models and servers that are deployed and available within that specific project.
