= Installing Python packages on your code-server workbench

[role='_abstract']
You can install Python packages that are not part of the default workbench image by adding the package and the version to a `requirements.txt` file and then running the `pip install` command in a terminal window.

NOTE: Although you can install packages directly, it is recommended that you use a `requirements.txt` file so that the packages stated in the file can be easily re-used across different notebooks.

.Prerequisites
* You have a running code-server workbench.

.Procedure
. In your code-server window, from the Activity Bar, select the menu icon (image:images/codeserver-menu-icon.png[Menu icon]) -> *File* -> *New Text File* to create a new text file.
. Add the packages to install to the text file.

You can specify the exact version to install by using the `==` (equal to) operator, for example:
+
[source]
----
altair==4.1.0

[NOTE]
====
{org-name} recommends specifying exact package versions to enhance the stability of your workbench over time. New package versions can introduce undesirable or unexpected changes in your environment's behavior.

To install multiple packages at the same time, place each package on a separate line.
. Save the text file as `requirements.txt`.
. From the Activity Bar, select the menu icon (image:images/codeserver-menu-icon.png[Menu icon]) -> *Terminal* -> *New Terminal*  to open a terminal window.
. Install the packages in `requirements.txt` to your server by using the following command:
+
[source]
----
pip install -r requirements.txt
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `pip install` command installs the package on your workbench. However, you must run the `import` statement to use the package in your code.

----
import altair
----

.Verification
* Confirm that the packages in the `requirements.txt` file appear in the list of packages installed on the workbench.
