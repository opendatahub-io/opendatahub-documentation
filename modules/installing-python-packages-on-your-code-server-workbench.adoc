= Installing Python packages on your code-server workbench

[role='_abstract']
You can install Python packages that are not part of the default workbench image by adding the package and the version to a `requirements.txt` file and then running the `pip install` command in a terminal window.

NOTE: You can install packages directly, but {org-name} recommends using a `requirements.txt` file so that the packages stated in the file can be easily re-used across different notebooks. In addition, a `requirements.txt` file is helpful when you want to deploy a model with an S2I build.

To install multiple packages at the same time, place each package on a separate line.
. Save the text file as `requirements.txt`.
. From the Activity Bar, select the menu icon (image:images/codeserver-menu-icon.png[Menu icon]) -> *Terminal* -> *New Terminal*  to open a terminal window.
. Install the packages in `requirements.txt` to your server by using the following command:
+
[source]
----
pip install -r requirements.txt
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `pip install` command installs the package on your workbench. However, you must run the `import` statement to use the package in your code.

----
import altair

.Verification
* Confirm that the packages in `requirements.txt` file appear in the list of packages installed on the workbench.
