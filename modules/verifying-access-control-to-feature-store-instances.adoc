= Verifying access control to your Feature Store instances

[role='_abstract']
You must ensure that access to Feature Stores is restricted based on defined roles and permissions.

To maintain regulatory compliance and safeguard sensitive data, the system uses role-based access control (RBAC), to determine which Feature Stores are visible to specific users. This mechanism mitigates potential vulnerabilities by preventing unauthorized users from discovering or selecting restricted Feature Stores.

.Prerequisites
* You must be logged into the Red Hat {org-name} dashboard.
* You must have the `feast-configs-registry` ConfigMap present in your infrastructure namespace (e.g., opendatahub or redhat-ods-applications).

.Procedure
* Log in to the Red Hat {org-name} dashboard.
* Define the specific user groups, namespaces or data science projects, requiring access to a Feature Store instance in your **Data science projects** permissions tab.
* Assign the appropriate RBAC permissions to user groups or data science projects in the Feature Store configuration maps.

.Verification
Verify the configuration by logging in as a user with restricted permissions to a specific feature store: 
** Attempt to create a workbench.
** Confirm that the **Select Feature Store** list displays only the instances the user is authorized to access.
** You can also log in as a user with no permissions and confirm that no Feature Stores are selectable. 

Your data access is now protected, ensuring that different personas access only the features appropriate for their role.

NOTE: The RBAC document displays all policies available in the Feast upstream. However, Red Hat {org-name} supports Group and Namespace/Data_Science_Project based authorization policies only. Role-based policies are _NOT_ supported.
