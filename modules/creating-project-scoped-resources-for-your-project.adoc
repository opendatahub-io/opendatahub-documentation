= Creating project-scoped resources for your project

[role='_abstract']
As an {productname-short}  user, you can access _global resources_ in all {productname-short} projects, but you can access _project-scoped resources_ within the specified project only.

As a user with access permissions to a project, you can create the following types of project-scoped resources for your {productname-short} project:

* Workbench images
* Model-serving runtimes for KServe
* Hardware profiles

All resource names must be unique within a project.

[NOTE]

A user with access permissions to a project can create project-scoped resources for that project, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/managing-odh/#creating-project-scoped-resources_managing-odh[Creating project-scoped resources].

.Prerequisites

* You can access the {openshift-platform} console.

ifdef::upstream[]
* An {productname-short} administrator has set the `disableProjectScoped` dashboard configuration option to `false`, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/managing-resources/#customizing-the-dashboard[Customizing the dashboard].
endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
* An {productname-short} administrator has set the `disableProjectScoped` dashboard configuration option to `false`, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/managing_resources/customizing-the-dashboard[Customizing the dashboard].
endif::[]

* You can access a project in the {productname-short} console.

* You have example YAML code for the type of resource that you want to create.
+
You can get the YAML code from a trusted source, such as an existing project-scoped resource, a Git repository, or documentation.
Alternatively, you can contact your cluster administrator to request the relevant YAML code.


.Procedure

. Log in to the {openshift-platform} console.
. From a trusted source, copy the YAML code that you want to use for your project resource.
+
For example, if you can access an existing project-scoped resource in one of your projects, you can copy the YAML code as follows:

.. In the *Administrator* perspective, click *Home* -> *Search*.
.. From the *Projects* list, select the appropriate project.
.. In the *Resources* list, search for the relevant resource type, as follows:

* For workbench images, search for `ImageStream`.
* For hardware profiles, search for `HardwareProfile`.
* For serving runtimes, search for `Template`. 
From the resulting list, find the templates that have the `objects.kind` specification set to `ServingRuntime`. 

.. Select a resource, and then click the *YAML* tab. 
.. Copy the YAML content, and then click *Cancel*.

. From the *Project* list, select your project name.
. From the toolbar, click the *+* icon to open the *Import YAML* page.
. Paste the example YAML content into the code area.
. Edit the `metadata.namespace` value to specify the name of your project.
. If necessary, edit the `metadata.name` value to ensure that the resource name is unique within the specified project.
. Optional: Edit the resource name that is displayed in the {productname-short} console, as follows:

* For workbench images, edit the `metadata.annotations.opendatahub.io/notebook-image-name` value.
* For hardware profiles, edit the `spec.displayName` value.
* For serving runtimes, edit the `objects.metadata.annotations.openshift.io/display-name` value.
. Click *Create*.


.Verification

. Log in to the {productname-short} console.
. Verify that the project-scoped resource is shown in the specified project:
