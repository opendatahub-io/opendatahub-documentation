[role="_abstract"]
{productname-short} provides support for accelerators through preinstalled model-serving runtimes.

== NVIDIA GPUs

ifndef::upstream[]
You can serve models with NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs) by using the *vLLM NVIDIA GPU ServingRuntime for KServe* runtime. To use the runtime, you must enable GPU support in {productname-short}. This includes installing and configuring the Node Feature Discovery Operator on your cluster. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/specialized_hardware_and_driver_enablement/psap-node-feature-discovery-operator#installing-the-node-feature-discovery-operator_psap-node-feature-discovery-operator[Installing the Node Feature Discovery Operator^] and link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/managing_openshift_ai/enabling-accelerators#enabling-nvidia-gpus_managing-rhoai[Enabling NVIDIA GPUs^].

== Intel Gaudi accelerators

ifdef::upstream[]
You can serve models with Intel Gaudi accelerators by using the *vLLM Intel Gaudi Accelerator ServingRuntime for KServe* runtime. To use the runtime, you must enable hybrid processing (HPU) support in {productname-short}. This includes installing the Intel Gaudi Base Operator and configuring a hardware profile. For more information, see link:https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Additional_Installation/OpenShift_Installation/index.html#openshift-installation[Intel Gaudi Base Operator OpenShift installation^] and link:{odhdocshome}/working-with-accelerators/#working-with-hardware-profiles_accelerators[Working with hardware profiles^].

[NOTE]
====
Warm-up is a model initialization and performance optimization step that is useful for reducing cold-start delays and first-inference latency. Depending on the model size, warm-up can lead to longer model loading times. 

While highly recommended in production environments to avoid performance limitations, you can choose to skip warm-up for non-production environments to reduce model loading times and accelerate model development and testing cycles.
ifndef::upstream[]
To skip warm-up, follow the steps described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/configuring_your_model-serving_platform/customizing_model_deployments#customizable-model-serving-runtime-parameters_rhoai-admin[Customizing the parameters of a deployed model-serving runtime] to add the following environment variable in the *Configuration parameters* section of your model deployment:
[source]
----
`VLLM_SKIP_WARMUP="true"`

== AMD GPUs

ifdef::upstream[]
You can serve models with AMD GPUs by using the *vLLM AMD GPU ServingRuntime for KServe* runtime. To use the runtime, you must enable support for AMD graphic processing units (GPUs) in {productname-short}. This includes installing the AMD GPU operator and configuring a hardware profile.
