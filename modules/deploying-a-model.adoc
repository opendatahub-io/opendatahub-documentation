= Deploying a model in {productname-short}

[role='_abstract']
You can deploy trained models on {productname-short} to enable you to test and implement them into intelligent applications. Deploying a model makes it available as a service that you can access using an API. This enables you to return predictions based on data inputs. 

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, `{oai-user-group}`oup}`) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, `{odh-user-group}`) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* You have created a data science project that contains an associated model server.
* You know the folder path for the data connection that you want the model to access.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Data Science Projects*.
+
The *Data science projects* page opens.
. Click the name of the project containing the model that you want to deploy.
+
A project details opens.
. In the *Models and model servers* section, next to the name of your model server, click *Deploy model*.
+
The *Deploy model* dialog opens.
. Configure properties for deploying your model as follows:
.. In the *Model Name* field, enter a unique name for the model that you are deploying.
.. From the *Model framework* list, select a framework for your model. 
+
NOTE: The *Model framework* list shows only the frameworks that are supported by the model-serving runtime that you specified when you configured your model server.
.. To specify the location of your model, perform one of the following sets of actions:
+
--
* *To use an existing data connection*
... Select *Existing data connection*.
... From the *Name* list, select a data connection that you previously defined.
... In the *Folder path* field, enter the folder path that contains the model in your specified data source.

* *To use a new data connection*
... To define a new data connection that your model can access, select *New data connection*.
... In the *Name* field, enter a unique name for the data connection.
... In the *Access key* field, enter your access key ID for Amazon Web Services (AWS).
... In the *Secret key* field, enter your secret access key for the AWS account you specified.
... In the *Endpoint* field, enter the endpoint of your AWS S3 storage.
... In the *Region* field, enter the default region of your AWS account.
... In the *Bucket* field, enter the name of the AWS S3 bucket.
... In the *Folder path* field, enter the folder path in your AWS S3 bucket that contains your data file.
