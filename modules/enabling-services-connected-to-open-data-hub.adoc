= Enabling services connected to {productname-short}

[role='_abstract']
You must enable SaaS-based services, such as Anaconda Professional Edition, before using them with {productname-long}. On-cluster services are enabled automatically.

Typically, you can install services, or enable services connected to {productname-short} using one of the following methods:

* Enabling the service from the *Explore* page on the {productname-short} dashboard, as documented in the following procedure.
* Installing the Operator for the service from OperatorHub. OperatorHub is a web console for cluster administrators to discover and select Operators to install on their cluster. It is deployed by default in {openshift-platform} (link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/operators/administrator-tasks#olm-installing-from-operatorhub-using-web-console_olm-adding-operators-to-a-cluster[Installing from OperatorHub using the web console]).

[NOTE]
====
Deployments containing Operators installed from OperatorHub may not be fully supported by Red Hat.

* Installing the Operator for the service from Red Hat Marketplace (link:https://marketplace.redhat.com/en-us/documentation/operators[Install Operators]).
* Installing the service as an {install-package} to your {openshift-platform} cluster (link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/operators/admin/olm-adding-operators-to-cluster.html[Adding Operators to a cluster]).

For some services (such as Jupyter), the service endpoint is available on the tile for the service on the *Enabled* page of {productname-short}. Certain services cannot be accessed directly from their tiles, for example, OpenVINO and Anaconda provide notebook images for use in Jupyter and do not provide an endpoint link from their tile. Additionally, it may be useful to store these endpoint URLs as environment variables for easy reference in a notebook environment.

Some independent software vendor (ISV) applications must be installed in specific {productname-short} Add-on namespaces. However, do not install ISV applications in namespaces associated with {productname-short} Add-ons unless you are specifically directed to do so on the application’s tile on the dashboard.

Some independent software vendor (ISV) applications must be installed in specific {productname-short} Operator namespaces. However, do not install ISV applications in namespaces associated with {productname-short} Operators unless you are specifically directed to do so on the tile for the application’s tile on the dashboard.

To help you get started quickly, you can access the service's learning resources and documentation on the **Resources** page, or by clicking the relevant link on the tile for the service on the **Enabled** page.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-short}.
* Your administrator has installed or configured the service on your OpenShift cluster.

.Procedure
