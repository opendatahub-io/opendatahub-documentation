= Using OCI containers for model storage

[role='_abstract']

As an alternative to storing a model in an S3 bucket or URI, you can upload models to Open Container Initiative (OCI) containers. Deploying models from OCI containers is also known as modelcars in KServe.

Using OCI containers for model storage can help you:

* Reduce startup times by avoiding downloading the same model multiple times.
* Reduce disk space usage by reducing the number of models downloaded locally.
* Improve model performance by allowing pre-fetched images.

Using OCI containers for model storage involves the following tasks:

* Storing a model in an OCI image.
* Deploying a model from an OCI image by using either the user interface or the command line interface. To deploy a model by using:
ifndef::upstream[]
** The user interface, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/deploying_models/deploying_models_on_the_model_serving_platform#deploying-models-on-the-model-serving-platform_rhoai-user[Deploying models on the model serving platform].
** The command line interface, see link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/deploying_models/deploying_models_on_the_model_serving_platform#deploying-model-stored-in-oci-image_rhoai-user[Deploying a model stored in an OCI image by using the CLI].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
** The user interface, see link:{odhdocshome}/deploying-models/#deploying-models-using-the-model-serving-platform_odh-user[Deploying models on the model serving platform].
** The command line interface, see link:{odhdocshome}/deploying-models/#deploying-model-stored-in-oci-image_odh-user[Deploying a model stored in an OCI image by using the CLI].
