= Accessing Hugging Face models with an environment variable token

[role='_abstract']

If the `LMEvalJob` needs to access a model on HuggingFace with the access token, you can set up the `HF_TOKEN` as one of the environment variables for the `lm-eval` container.


.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
* Your cluster administrator has installed {productname-short} and enabled the TrustyAI service for the data science project where the models are deployed.

.Procedure

. To start an evaluation job for a `huggingface` model, apply the following YAML file to your data science project through the CLI:
+
[source]
----
apiVersion: trustyai.opendatahub.io/v1
kind: LMEvalJob
metadata:
  name: evaljob-sample
spec:
  model: hf
  modelArgs:
  - name: pretrained
    value: huggingfacespace/model
  taskList:
    taskNames:
    - unfair_tos/
  logSamples: true
  pod:
    container:
      env:
      - name: HF_TOKEN
        value: "My HuggingFace token"
----
+ 
For example: 
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
---- 
$ oc apply -f <yaml_file> -n <project_name> 
----
. (Optional) You can also create a secret to store the token, then refer the key from the `secretKeyRef` object using the following reference syntax:
+
[source]
----
env:
  - name: HF_TOKEN
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: my-secret
        key: hf-token
