= Setting up the Feature Store user interface for initial use

[role='_abstract']
You can use a web-based user interface to simplify and accelerate the creation of model development features. This visual interface helps you explore and understand your Feature Store. 

You can use the Feature Store UI to access a centralized catalog of features and metadata, such as transformation logic and materialization job status. You can also view features, manage entities, and use lineage and search capabilities.

You must enable the Feature Store UI before you can use it.

.Prerequisites
* You have Administrator access.
* You have enabled the Feast Operator.
* You have created a Feature Store CRD, as described in _Creating a Feature Store instance in a data science project_. 						
* Your REST API server is running. 

.Procedure

. Log in to the {productname-short} Dashboard and click the **Feature Store** tab on the left navigation.
. On the **Overview** page, click the **create FeatureStore** button.
. Add YAML definitions to enable the user interface. 
. Edit the following label to enable the UI:
.. `Label:`
.. `feature-store-ui: enabled`
.. This creates a pod and initiates the service registry.

. Click the options icon (&#8942;) and choose **Start job**.
. Click on the **Jobs** tab and then **Logs** on the left navigation, to confirm that the CronJob is running.
. Navigate to the **Feature views** tab on the left navigation, and you will be able to see your new UI.

.Verification
Click **Overview**. If your Feature Store user interface was created, you see the following cards:
* Entities
* Data sources
* Datasets
* Features
* Feature views 
* Feature services
