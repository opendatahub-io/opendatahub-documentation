= Enabling custom images in {productname-short}

All {productname-short} administrators can import custom workbench images, by default, by selecting the *Settings* -> *Environment setup* -> *Workbench images* navigation option in the {productname-short} dashboard.

If the *Settings* -> *Environment setup* -> *Workbench images* option is not available, check the following settings, depending on which navigation element does not appear in the dashboard:

* The *Settings* menu does not appear in the {productname-short} navigation bar.
+
The visibility of the {productname-short} dashboard *Settings* menu is determined by your user permissions. By default, the *Settings* menu is available to {productname-short} administration users (users that are members of the {admin-group} group). Users with the OpenShift `cluster-admin` role are automatically added to the {admin-group} group and are granted administrator access in {productname-short}.

* The *Workbench images* menu item does not appear under the *Settings* menu.
+
The visibility of the *Workbench images* menu item is controlled in the dashboard configuration, by the value of the `dashboardConfig: disableBYONImageStream` option. It is set to *false* (the *Workbench images* menu item is visible) by default. 
+
You need {productname-short} administrator permissions to edit the dashboard configuration.
