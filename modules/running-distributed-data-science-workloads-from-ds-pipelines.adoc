= Running distributed data science workloads from data science pipelines

[role='_abstract']
To run a distributed data science workload from a data science pipeline, you must first update the pipeline to include a link to your Ray cluster image.

.Prerequisites
ifdef::upstream,self-managed[]
* You have logged in to {openshift-platform} with the `cluster-admin` role.
endif::[]
ifdef::cloud-service[]
* You have logged in to OpenShift with the `cluster-admin` role.
endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
* You have access to a data science cluster that is configured to run distributed workloads as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/working-with-distributed-workloads_distributed-workloads#configuring-distributed-workloads_distributed-workloads[Configuring distributed workloads].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* You have access to a data science cluster that is configured to run distributed workloads as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working_on_data_science_projects/#configuring-distributed-workloads_distributed-workloads[Configuring distributed workloads].
endif::[]
* You have installed the {org-name} OpenShift Pipelines Operator, as described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/cicd/pipelines#installing-pipelines[Installing OpenShift Pipelines].
* You have access to S3-compatible object storage.
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
* You have created a data science project.

.Procedure
ifndef::upstream[]
. Create a data connection to connect the object storage to your data science project, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/working-on-data-science-projects_nb-server#adding-a-data-connection-to-your-data-science-project_nb-server[Adding a data connection to your data science project].
. Configure a pipeline server to use the data connection, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/working-with-data-science-pipelines_ds-pipelines#configuring-a-pipeline-server_ds-pipelines[Configuring a pipeline server].
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
. Create a data connection to connect the object storage to your data science project, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working_on_data_science_projects/#adding-a-data-connection-to-your-data-science-project_nb-server[Adding a data connection to your data science project].
. Configure a pipeline server to use the data connection, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working_on_data_science_projects/#configuring-a-pipeline-server_ds-pipelines[Configuring a pipeline server].
endif::[]
. Create the data science pipeline as follows:
.. Install the `kfp-tekton` Python package, which is required for all pipelines:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ pip install kfp-tekton
----
.. Install any other dependencies that are required for your pipeline.
.. Build your data science pipeline in Python code.
For example, create a file named `compile_example.py` with the following content:
+
[source,Python]
----
from kfp import components, dsl

   auth = TokenAuthentication( <2>
       token=openshift_token, server=openshift_server, skip_tls=True
   )
   auth_return = auth.login()
   cluster = Cluster( <3>
       ClusterConfiguration(
           name="raytest",
           # namespace must exist
           namespace="pipeline-example",
           num_workers=1,
           head_cpus="500m",

           instascale=False, <5>
       )
   )


   print(cluster.status())
   cluster.up() <6>
   cluster.wait_ready() <7>
   print(cluster.status())
   print(cluster.details())


   ray_dashboard_uri = cluster.cluster_dashboard_uri()
   ray_cluster_uri = cluster.cluster_uri()
   print(ray_dashboard_uri, ray_cluster_uri)


   # Before proceeding, ensure that the cluster exists and that its URI contains a value
   assert ray_cluster_uri, "Ray cluster must be started and set before proceeding"


   ray.init(address=ray_cluster_uri)
   print("Ray cluster is up and running: ", ray.is_initialized())


   @ray.remote
   def train_fn(): <8>
       # complex training function
       return 100


   result = ray.get(train_fn.remote())
   assert 100 == result
   ray.shutdown()
   cluster.down() <9>
   auth.logout()
   return result


@dsl.pipeline( <10>

def ray_integration(openshift_server, openshift_token):
   ray_op = components.create_component_from_func(
       ray_fn,
       base_image='registry.redhat.io/ubi8/python-39:latest',
       packages_to_install=["codeflare-sdk"],
   )
   ray_op(openshift_server, openshift_token)


if __name__ == '__main__': <11>
    from kfp_tekton.compiler import TektonCompiler
    TektonCompiler().compile(ray_integration, 'compiled-example.yaml')

----
<1> Imports from the CodeFlare SDK the packages that define the cluster functions
<2> Authenticates with the cluster by using values that you specify when creating the pipeline run
<3> Specifies the Ray cluster resources: replace these example values with the values for your Ray cluster
<4> Specifies the location of the Ray cluster image: if using a disconnected environment, replace the default value with the location for your environment
<5> InstaScale is not supported in this release
<6> Creates a Ray cluster using the specified image and configuration
<7> Waits for the Ray cluster to be ready before proceeding
<8> Replace the example details in this section with the details for your workload
<9> Removes the Ray cluster when your workload is finished
<10> Replace the example name and description with the values for your workload
<11> Compiles the Python code and saves the output in a YAML file

.. Compile the Python file (in this example, the `compile_example.py` file):
+
[source,bash]
----
$ python compile_example.py
----
This command creates a YAML file (in this example, `compiled-example.yaml`), which you can import in the next step.
