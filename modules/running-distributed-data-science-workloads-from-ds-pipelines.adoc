= Running distributed data science workloads from data science pipelines

[role='_abstract']
To run a distributed data science workload from a data science pipeline, you must first update the pipeline to include a link to your Ray cluster image.

endif::[]

ifndef::upstream[]
* Optional: You have defined a _default_ local queue for the Ray cluster by creating a `LocalQueue` resource and adding the following annotation to the configuration details for that `LocalQueue` resource, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_with_distributed_workloads/configuring-distributed-workloads_distributed-workloads#configuring-quota-management-for-distributed-workloads_distributed-workloads[Configuring quota management for distributed workloads]:
+
[source,bash]
----
"kueue.x-k8s.io/default-queue": "true"
----

[NOTE]
====
If you do not create a default local queue, you must specify a local queue in each pipeline.

* You have access to S3-compatible object storage.
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
* You have created a data science project.

.Procedure
ifndef::upstream[]
. Create a data connection to connect the object storage to your data science project, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/working-on-data-science-projects_nb-server#adding-a-data-connection-to-your-data-science-project_nb-server[Adding a data connection to your data science project].

endif::[]

ifndef::upstream[]
. Configure a pipeline server to use the data connection, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/working-with-data-science-pipelines_ds-pipelines#configuring-a-pipeline-server_ds-pipelines[Configuring a pipeline server].

. Configure a pipeline server to use the data connection, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working-on-data-science-projects/#configuring-a-pipeline-server_ds-pipelines[Configuring a pipeline server].
endif::[]

. Create the data science pipeline as follows:
.. Install the `kfp` Python package, which is required for all pipelines:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ pip install kfp
----
.. Install any other dependencies that are required for your pipeline.
.. Build your data science pipeline in Python code.
+
For example, create a file named `compile_example.py` with the following content:
+
[source,Python]

----
<1> Imports from the CodeFlare SDK the packages that define the cluster functions
<2> Authenticates with the cluster by using values that you specify when creating the pipeline run;
if your cluster uses self-signed certificates, include `ca-cert-path=<path>` in the `TokenAuthentication` parameter list, where `<path>` is the path to the cluster-wide Certificate Authority (CA) bundle that contains the self-signed certificates
// Commenting out second part of callout 2 until RHOAIENG-880 is fixed
//; you can omit this section if the Ray cluster is configured to use the same namespace as the data science project
<3> Specifies the Ray cluster configuration: replace these example values with the values for your Ray cluster
<4> Specifies the location of the Ray cluster image: if using a disconnected environment, replace the default value with the location for your environment
<5> Specifies the local queue to which the Ray cluster will be submitted: you can omit this line if you configured a default local queue
<6> Creates a Ray cluster using the specified image and configuration
<7> Waits for the Ray cluster to be ready before proceeding
<8> Enables the Ray client to connect to a secure Ray cluster that has mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) enabled; mTLS is enabled by default in the CodeFlare component in {productname-short}
<9> Replace the example details in this section with the details for your workload
<10> Removes the Ray cluster when your workload is finished
<11> Replace the example name and description with the values for your workload
<12> Compiles the Python code and saves the output in a YAML file

.. Compile the Python file (in this example, the `compile_example.py` file):
+
[source,bash]
----
$ python compile_example.py
----
This command creates a YAML file (in this example, `compiled-example.yaml`), which you can import in the next step.
