= About KServe deployment modes

By default, you can deploy models on the single-model serving platform with KServe by using link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_serverless/{os-latest-version}/html/about_openshift_serverless/index[{org-name} OpenShift Serverless^], which is a cloud-native development model that allows for serverless deployments of models. OpenShift Serverless is based on the open source link:https://knative.dev/docs/[Knative^] project. In addition, serverless mode is dependent on the {org-name} OpenShift Serverless Operator. 

Alternatively, you can use raw deployment mode, which is not dependent on the {org-name} OpenShift Serverless Operator. With raw deployment mode, you can deploy models with Kubernetes resources, such as `Deployment`, `Service`, `Ingress`, and `Horizontal Pod Autoscaler`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Deploying a machine learning model using KServe raw deployment mode is a Limited Availability feature. Limited Availability means that you can install and receive support for the feature only with specific approval from the {org-name} AI Business Unit. Without such approval, the feature is unsupported. In addition, this feature is only supported on Self-Managed deployments of single node OpenShift.

There are both advantages and disadvantages to using each of these deployment modes:

== Serverless mode

Advantages:

* Enables autoscaling based on request volume: 
** Resources scale up automatically when receiving incoming requests.
** Optimizes resource usage and maintains performance during peak times.

* Supports scale down to and from zero using Knative:
** Allows resources to scale down completely when there are no incoming requests.
** Saves costs by not running idle resources.

Disadvantages:

* Has customization limitations: 
** Serverless is limited to Knative, such as when mounting multiple volumes.

* Dependency on Knative for scaling: 
** Introduces additional complexity in setup and management compared to traditional scaling methods.

== Raw deployment mode

Advantages:

* Enables deployment with Kubernetes resources, such as `Deployment`, `Service`, `Ingress`, and `Horizontal Pod Autoscaler`: 
** Provides full control over Kubernetes resources, allowing for detailed customization and configuration of deployment settings.

* Unlocks Knative limitations, such as being unable to mount multiple volumes: 
** Beneficial for applications requiring complex configurations or multiple storage mounts.

Disadvantages:

* Does not support automatic scaling:
** Does not support automatic scaling down to zero resources when idle.
** Might result in higher costs during periods of low traffic.

* Requires manual management of scaling.
