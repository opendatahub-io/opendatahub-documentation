= Uploading model files to a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)

When deploying a model, you can serve it from a preexisting Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) where your model files are stored. You can upload your local model files to a PVC in the IDE that you access from a running workbench.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the {productname-short} dashboard.
* You have access to a project that has a running workbench.
* You have created a persistent volume claim (PVC) with a context type of *Model storage*.
* The workbench is attached to the persistent volume (PVC).

* You have the model files saved on your local machine.

.Procedure

Follow these steps to upload your model files to the PVC mount point (`/opt/app-root/src/`) within your workbench:

. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click the open icon (image:images/open.png[The open icon]) to open your IDE in a new window.
. In your IDE, navigate to the *File Browser* pane on the left-hand side.
.. In JupyterLab, this is usually labeled *Files*.
.. In code-server, this is usually the *Explorer* view.
. In the file browser, navigate to the `/opt/app-root/src/` folder. This folder represents the root of your attached PVC.
+
NOTE: Any files or folders that you create or upload to this folder persist in the PVC.
. Optional: Create a new folder to organize your models:
.. In the file browser, right-click within the `/opt/app-root/src/` folder in the file browser and select *New Folder*.
.. Name the folder (for example, `models`).
.. Double-click the new `models` folder to enter it.
. Upload your model files to the current folder (`/opt/app-root/src/` or `/opt/app-root/src/models/`):
* *Using JupyterLab:*
.. Click the *Upload Files* icon (image:images/jupyter-upload-file.png[Upload files icon, title="Upload files icon"]) in the file browser toolbar above the folder listing.
.. In the file selection dialog, navigate to and select the model files from your local computer. Click *Open*.
.. Wait for the upload progress bars next to the filenames to complete.
* *Using code-server:*
.. Drag the model files directly from your local file explorer and drop them into the file browser pane in the target folder within code-server.
. Wait for the upload process to complete.

.Verification

* Confirm that your files appear in the file browser at the path where you uploaded them.

.Next steps

When you follow the procedure to deploy a model, you can access the model files from the specified path within your PVC:

. In the *Deploy model* dialog, select *Existing cluster storage* under the *Source model location* section.
. From the *Cluster storage* list, select the PVC associated with your workbench.
. In the *Model path* field, enter the path to your model or the folder containing your model.
