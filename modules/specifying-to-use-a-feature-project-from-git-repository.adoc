= Specifying to use a feature project from a Git repository

[role='_abstract']
If you want to start with a pre-existing feature project that exists in a Git repository, create a feature store instance that includes a reference to the feature project location in the Git repository.

NOTE: The example code in the following procedure requires that you edit it with values that are specific to your use case.

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator privileges for your {openshift-platform} cluster.

* You have enabled the Feature Store component, as described in _Enabling the Feature Store component_.

ifndef::upstream[]
* You have created a data science project, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/using-data-science-projects_projects#creating-a-data-science-project_projects[Creating a data science project]. In the following procedure, `my-ds-project` is the name of the data science project.
endif::[]

ifdef::upstream[]
* You have created a data science project, as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working-on-data-science-projects/#creating-a-data-science-project_projects[Creating a data science project]. In the following procedure, `my-ds-project` is the name of the data science project.
endif::[]

* You have an existing feature store project in an existing Git repository.

.Procedure

. In the OpenShift console, click the *Quick Create* (image:images/quick-create-icon.png[]) icon and then click the *Import YAML* option.
. Verify that your data science project is the selected project.
. Copy the following example code and paste it into the YAML editor: 
+
[source,yaml]
----   
apiVersion: feast.dev/v1alpha1
kind: FeatureStore
metadata:
  name: sample-git-repopath
spec:
  feastProject: feast_demo_odfv
  feastProjectDir:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/feast-dev/feast-workshop # <1>
      ref: e959053    # <2>
      featureRepoPath: module_2/feature_repo  # <3>
----
<1> The URL for the Git repository.
<2> The Git commit ID or branch.
<3> The path to the feature store repository that you want to use.

. Edit the Git repository URL, the reference (commit ID or branch), and the path to specify values that are specific to your use case.

. Click *Create*.

.Verification

. In the {openshift-platform} console, select *Workloads* -> *Pods*.
. Make sure that your project (for example, `my-ds-project`) is selected.
. Find the pod that has the `feast-` prefix, followed by the metadata name that you specified in the CRD configuration, for example, `feast-sample-git-repopath`.
. Verify that the status is *Running*.
