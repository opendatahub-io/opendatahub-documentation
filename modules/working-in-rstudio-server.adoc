Technology Preview features are not supported with Red{nbsp}Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete.
Red{nbsp}Hat does not recommend using them in production.
These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red{nbsp}Hat Technology Preview features, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].

{productname-long} includes the following RStudio Server workbench images:

* *RStudio Server notebook image*
+
With the *RStudio Server* notebook image, you can access the RStudio IDE, an integrated development environment for R. The R programming language is used for statistical computing and graphics to support data analysis and predictions.
+
To use the *RStudio Server* notebook image, you must first build it by creating a secret and triggering the `BuildConfig`, and then enable it in the {productname-short} UI by editing the `rstudio-rhel9` image stream. 
See link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/getting_started_with_{url-productname-long}/configuring-your-ide_get-started#building_the_rstudio_server_notebook_images[Building the RStudio Server notebook images] for more information.

* *CUDA - RStudio Server notebook image*
+
With the *CUDA - RStudio Server* notebook image, you can access the RStudio IDE and NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit. The RStudio IDE is an integrated development environment for the R programming language for statistical computing and graphics. With the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit, you can enhance your work by using GPU-accelerated libraries and optimization tools.

== Building the RStudio Server notebook images

To use the *RStudio Server* and *CUDA - RStudio Server* notebook images, you must first build them by creating a secret and triggering the `BuildConfig`, and then enable them in the {productname-short} UI by editing the `rstudio-rhel9` and `cuda-rstudio-rhel9` image streams.

.Prerequisites
* Before starting the RStudio Server build process, you have at least 1 CPU and 2Gi memory available for `rstudio-server-rhel9`, and 1.5 CPUs and 8Gi memory available for `cuda-rstudio-server-rhel9` on your cluster.
* You are logged in to your OpenShift cluster.
* You have the `cluster-admin` role in {openshift-platform}.
* You have an active {org-name} Enterprise Linux (RHEL) subscription.

.Procedure
. Create a secret with Subscription Manager credentials. These are usually your {org-name} Customer Portal username and password.
+
Note: The secret must be named `rhel-subscription-secret`, and its `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` keys must be in capital letters.
+
----
oc create secret generic rhel-subscription-secret --from-literal=USERNAME=<username> --from-literal=PASSWORD=<password> -n redhat-ods-applications
----
. Start the build:
.. To start the lightweight RStudio Server build:
+
----
oc start-build rstudio-server-rhel9 -n redhat-ods-applications --follow
----
.. To start the CUDA-enabled RStudio Server build, trigger the `cuda-rhel9` BuildConfig:
+
----
oc start-build cuda-rhel9 -n redhat-ods-applications --follow
----
+
The cuda-rhel9 build is a prerequisite for cuda-rstudio-rhel9. The cuda-rstudio-rhel9 build starts automatically.
. Confirm that the build process has completed successfully using the following command. Successful builds appear as `Complete`.
+
----
oc get builds -n redhat-ods-applications
----
. After the builds complete successfully, use the following commands to make the notebook images available in the {productname-short} UI.
.. To enable the RStudio Server notebook image:
+
----
oc label -n redhat-ods-applications imagestream rstudio-rhel9 opendatahub.io/notebook-image='true'
----
.. To enable the CUDA - RStudio Server notebook image:
+
----
oc label -n redhat-ods-applications imagestream cuda-rstudio-rhel9 opendatahub.io/notebook-image='true'
----

.Verification
* You can see *RStudio Server* and *CUDA - RStudio Server* images on the *Applications* -> *Enabled* menu in the {productname-long} dashboard.
* You can see *R Studio Server* or *CUDA - RStudio Server* in the *Data Science Projects* -> *Workbenches* -> *Create workbench* -> *Notebook image* -> *Image selection* dropdown list.
