= Running distributed data science workloads from notebooks

[role='_abstract']
To run a distributed data science workload from a notebook, you must first provide the link to your Ray cluster image.

.Prerequisites
* You have created a data science project that contains a workbench that is running one of the default notebook images, for example, the *Standard Data Science* notebook.
See the table in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/creating-and-importing-notebooks_notebooks#notebook-images-for-data-scientists[Notebook images for data scientists] for a complete list of default notebook images.
* You have launched your notebook server and logged in to Jupyter.

.Procedure
. To access the demo notebooks, clone the `codeflare-sdk` repository as follows:
.. In the JupyterLab interface, click *Git > Clone a Repository*.
.. In the "Clone a repo" dialog, enter `https://github.com/project-codeflare/codeflare-sdk.git` and then click *Clone*.
The `codeflare-sdk` repository is listed in the left navigation pane.
. Run a distributed workload job as shown in the following example:
.. In the JupyterLab interface, in the left navigation pane, double-click *codeflare-sdk*.
.. Double-click *demo-notebooks*, and then double-click *guided-demos*.
.. Update each example demo notebook as follows:
** Replace the links to the example community image with a link to your Ray cluster image.
** Set `instascale` to `False`.
InstaScale is not deployed in the Technology Preview version of the distributed workloads feature.
.. Run the notebooks.


.Verification
The notebooks run to completion without errors. In the notebooks, the output from the `cluster.status()` function or `cluster.details()` function indicates that the Ray cluster is `Active`.
