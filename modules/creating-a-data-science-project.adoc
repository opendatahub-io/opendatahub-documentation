= Creating a data science project

[role='_abstract']
To implement a data science workflow, you must create a project. In OpenShift, a project is a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations, and is the main way that you can manage user access to resources. A project organizes your data science work in one place and also allows you to collaborate with other developers and data scientists in your organization.

Within a project, you can add the following functionality: 

* Data connections so that you can access data without having to hardcode information like endpoints or credentials.
* Workbenches for working with and processing data, and for developing models.
* Deployed models so that you can test them and then integrate them into intelligent applications. Deploying a model makes it available as a service that you can access by using an API. 
* Pipelines for automating your ML workflow.


.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {oai-user-group} or {oai-admin-group} ) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, {odh-user-group} or {odh-admin-group}) in OpenShift.
endif::[]

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, select *Data Science Projects*.

. Click *Create data science project*.

. In the *Create a data science project* dialog, enter a display *Name* for your project.

. Optional: Edit the *Resource name* for your data science project. The resource name must consist of lowercase alphanumeric characters, '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
+
*Note:* After you create a project, you can change the project display name but you cannot change the resource name.

. Enter a *description* for your data science project.
. Click *Create*.


.Verification

* A project details page opens. From this page, you can add data connections, create workbenches, configure pipelines, and deploy models.
