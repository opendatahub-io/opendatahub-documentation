= Configuring a custom notebook image

[role='_abstract']
In addition to notebook images provided and supported by Red Hat and independent software vendors (ISVs), you can configure custom notebook images that cater to your project's specific requirements.

Red Hat supports you in adding custom notebook images to your deployment of {productname-short} and ensuring that they are available for selection when creating a notebook server. However, Red Hat does not support the contents of your custom notebook image. That is, if your custom notebook image is available for selection during notebook server creation, but does not create a usable notebook server, Red Hat does not provide support to fix your custom notebook image.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::self-managed[]
* You are part of the `dedicated-admins` user group in {openshift-platform}.
endif::[]
ifdef::self-managed[]

endif::[]
* Your custom notebook image exists in an image registry and is accessible.
