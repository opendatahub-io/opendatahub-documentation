= Governing LLM access with models-as-a-service

Models-as-a-Service (MaaS) provides tier-based governance for large language model serving in {productname-long}. MaaS enables administrators to define service tiers with different rate limits and quotas, control access through API key authentication, and track resource consumption for cost allocation. Users can discover available models, generate authentication credentials, and integrate models into their applications using OpenAI-compatible APIs.
